Synopsis
--------
Western Union Money Order machines are Ethernet-connected and located in Customer Service.

Solution
--------
- The Western Union Money Order machine is a standalone device that prints Money Orders at the Customer Service Desk.
- It is separate from the Money Transfer or CSP (Customer Service Portal) PC.
- Note: Western Union money transfers (person-to-person) are mostly done via CSP; some stores still have separate WU money transfer PCs.

- Money Orders function like printed checks given to customers and can be used for vendor payments onsite.
- The WUTAIO touchscreen and printer are used for this purpose.
- Note: For Money Orders over $3,000, additional compliance options are required, such as ID verification and entering a valid country code.

Device Support
--------------
- Stores should contact Western Union directly for device issues or damage: 1-877-986-3937.
- Note: For non-connectivity issues, if WU sends the problem back to Kroger repeatedly, contact your Division money services representative or escalate with a WU supervisor.
- APP-KPF does not support login issues.

Network Troubleshooting
-----------------------
- KSC supports network connectivity for the machine.
- If device shows “No line available” or can’t print/sell Money Orders:
  - Confirm if the device was recently replaced.
  - Verify MAC address visibility on VLAN 2900 switch port (especially if touchscreen was updated recently).
  - Check cabling behind the device (no phone lines should be connected).
- For new touchscreen installs with "No Line connected" errors, confirm MAC is updated in TUNA (Vendor segment).

Verify the Money Order Machine is in TUNA
-----------------------------------------
1. Find the MAC address on the device label or via system LAN setup.
2. Log in to TUNA:
   - Locate the old machine in the Vendor segment.
   - Update the MAC address to the new device.
   - See Adding or Removing Devices in TUNA for more info.
3. Have store swap the hardware.
4. Advise store to perform a parameter download on the machine:
   - Select Setup > Load Parameters > IP
   - If parameters load, test the machine.
   - If not, proceed to next troubleshooting steps.

Verify the Ethernet Connection
------------------------------
- WU devices will NOT ping by design.
1. Find switch and port in Netmap or core switch using MAC address.
   - If device is on VLAN 2900, network side is good — have store contact WU.
   - If MAC is not found, continue troubleshooting.
2. Check if device is blocked by Radius:
   - Run switch commands to check for rejection or failure.
   - Update MAC address as needed.
3. Swap cables with a working device:
   - If swapped device shows up, issue is with cable.
   - If not, suspect long run cable.
   - Email DTL and Backup DTL to dispatch internal cabling support (do NOT dispatch external vendor).
   - Close incident after dispatch email.

Escalation
----------
- If WUTAIO device is online but WU cannot contact it:
  - Attempt to load parameters again.
  - If unable, direct store to contact Western Union.
- When escalating to APP-KPF:
  - Verify device is on the network.
  - If no troubleshooting done by WU, conference store with WU and document agent info and call outcome.
  - Retry parameter load and record results.
  - Record Terminal ID from machine (Setup > View Terminal).

Additional Information
----------------------
- Western Union supports the money order machine hardware.
- KSC only supports network connectivity.
