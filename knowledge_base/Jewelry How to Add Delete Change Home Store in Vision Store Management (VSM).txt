Jewelry: How to Add Delete Change Home Store in Vision Store Management (VSM)
KB0011676
===============================================================================

Description
-----------
In Vision Store Management (VSM), store users can log in using their EUID/password and manage multiple store assignments. This is also used to update stores for Support Center associates (without selecting a Home Store).

Cause
-----
- New associate
- Associate changing stores
- Associate filling in at another store

Note: This does NOT update automatically with associate transfers. Manual update required.

IMPORTANT:
- Always ADD the new store BEFORE deleting the old store to avoid accidental account deletion.
- If an error occurs while adding/removing, capture the full error message.

Resolution
----------
NOTE:
- If VSM issues occur, try using a store laptop (menu options may be missing on other devices).
- Associates are NOT deleted from VSM, only store assignments are removed.
- Desktop login is possible. If login fails, adjust browser settings or remote into register.

If over 10 stores must be removed, send a P3 ticket to: App-Merch-ORE2.0-Jewelry.

ADD STORE
---------
DO NOT add "FMJ" to location list.

1. Log in to Vision Store Management.
2. Select: Operations > System User Details > User Maintenance.
3. Search by entering EUID in "User Last/First Name", click Search.
4. Highlight and click the correct name (use UPPERCASE profile only).
   - If only lowercase exists or uppercase profile is missing, escalate to App-Merch-ORE2.0-Jewelry.

5. Verify Person Details.
   - Ensure Date of Birth is entered.
   - Click Next.

6. Click "Add".
7. Enter the 5-digit store number and click "Search" (DO NOT hit Enter).
   - Only add VALID STORE locations (no office/support IDs).
   - DO NOT set a closed store as the Home Store.

8. In the new window, double-click on the store number.
9. Click "Next", then "Save".
10. Log out of VSM and log in to the new store.
    - Press F5 to refresh if needed.

Changing Home Store:
- Click current Home Store, uncheck it.
- Check the new Home Store.
- Click "Save".

REMOVE STORE
------------
NOTE: Only store assignments are removed, NOT users.

ALWAYS add new store before removing old.

1. Follow Steps 1â€“8 above.
2. Select store to delete and click "Delete".
3. Confirm deletion when prompted.
4. Click "Save".

NEW ASSOCIATES or NO PROFILE FOUND
----------------------------------
- Must have an active EUID and IAM account.
- Store associates must show a Jewelry role in IMT.

First-time login to Gemstore builds their VSM profile. After login, store changes can be made in VSM.

ESCALATION
----------
- If unresolved, send low urgency ticket to: App-Merch-ORE2.0-Jewelry.
- ALL escalations must go through Frontend Tier 2 first.
