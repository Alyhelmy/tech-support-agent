Note: If more than ½ of the registers are displaying “System Busy” warm transfer the call to a Frontend Tier 2.

1. Ping and connect to both the MC and CC controller.

  - If you can not ping, or connect to either controller or if the connection to either controller is slow, transfer the call to a FE Tier 2.

2. Access background messaging and look for W971 System PD, W754 Fixed Disk errors. If errors are found, transfer the call to a FE Tier2.

Note:  If all registers are displaying system busy and are not able to reload, there could be a communication issue with the controllers to the registers.  Frontend Tier 2 may need to reboot all controllers one at a time starting with the MC and waiting till it loads back up to reboot the next and so on etc.  Please reach out to APP-POS in their chat with Tier 2 if unsure.

3. If less than 1/2 of the registers are affected, and there are no errors on the controllers, continue.

4. Document what the user did just before the terminal went to “System Busy”

5. Document if there is a different error displayed on the pole, or the customer display vs. keyboard display.

6. If an error is found, search for error documentation and follow relevant troubleshooting, see: Basic POS Register Troubleshooting.

7. If there are no errors indicating a problem, check the thermal printer and Sensormatic devices for possible problems.

  - Reseat the thermal printer logic card for IBM printer.

  - Check for paper.

  - Power the printer off and on with the printer power button.

8. Instruct the user to power cycle the register, if it's still not responding. See: How to Reboot Register or Load Terminal Configuration ( 9-Load )

9. Verify the lights are out on keyboard and printer. Leave off for 30 to 60 seconds before powering back on.

10. The register should return to the point before it froze and the user can continue with the order.

11. If the register comes back with the same issue/error, warm transfer the call to Frontend Tier 2.
