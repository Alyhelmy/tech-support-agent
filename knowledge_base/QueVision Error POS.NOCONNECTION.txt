**Description:**  
This document explains the cause and resolution of the EPOS error: **"NOCONNECTION"**.  
This error is auto-sent via SNMP and generates an **Infra ticket**.

📌 **Note:** This is normal for **new installations** if the POS feed has not been activated. **No action required** in such cases.

**Cause:**
The SDI (System Data Interface) is not detecting an active inbound connection from the Integration Server's broker.

3. Store reports monitor is red with no lanes being shown or predicted

**Resolution:**

1. Open a web browser and go to:  
   `http://sdi.xx###` *(xx = division, ### = store number)*  
   OR use the **SDI IP address** from TUNA

2. Click on **Support Center**  
   - Log in using credentials from the **Confidential Password List**  
   - Navigate to **Help Center**

3. **Document details** from the Help Center in the ticket.
