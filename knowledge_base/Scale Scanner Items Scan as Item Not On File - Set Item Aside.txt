RESOLUTION:
-----------

🔸 Step 1: Check for Invalid PLU Entry
- Confirm customer didn’t enter a wrong PLU (e.g., 4501 instead of 2501)

🔸 Step 2: Confirm Item in Item Record File (IRF)
- Scan item at a Front End Register.
  - If error occurs there too → Item not in IRF
    → Follow: *RDIC Pricing and Contact Info for Escalation*

🔸 Step 3: All Items Failing to Scan?
- Run **FIXIT** on lane(s)
  → See: *How to Run FIXIT*
- Send a **9-load** to the affected lane(s)

🔸 Step 4: Weighable/Produce Items Not Weighing?
- Follow: *Toshiba SCO - Scale/Scanner Basic Troubleshooting*

🔸 Step 5: “Set Item Aside” / “Not on File” Error on SCO
- Try scanning same item at another SCO or Front End Register
  - If it scans: 
    - Collect an **extract** (include terminal #, time, date)
    - Perform **hardboot** from UPS (off for 2 minutes)
      ⚠️ For System 6 or 7 – DO NOT power cycle the UPS
    - Reload lane and test again
    - If issue persists: escalate to **Frontend Tier 2** for **APP-POS** escalation

🔸 Step 6: Accidental Barcode Scan?
- Check if the scanned item was not a product (e.g., competitor loyalty card)
- If a valid item still does not scan, follow **Not On File (NOF)** procedures as at the front end
  → See: *RDIC Pricing and Contact Information*

🔸 Step 7: Quick Lookup Option Issues?
- If issue is related to Quick Lookup or lane-only item setup
  → See: *Toshiba SCO - Pricing - Data/Maintenance Setup Issues*

-----------------------------------------------------
NOTES:
------
- Document extract data before escalation
- Hardware issues may require scanner calibration check
- Emphasize correct NOF process at store level for missing items
