Multiple Registers Are Reloading, Displaying a W410 PROGRAM REQUESTED TERM. IPL
KB0012293 
===============================================================================

Description
-----------
Multiple registers/lanes are restarting themselves when signed off.

This usually happens after a controller reboot for various reasons such as
power failure, manual reboot, or other unexpected restarts.

- If a register “crashes” or reboots on its own, check if a terminal dump was
  created on the POS Controller.
- If a dump exists, format it and escalate to Frontend Tier 2 to escalate to
  APP-POS for Toshiba review.
- If no dump was created, check if the dump flag is enabled. If not, enable it
  for future occurrences.

Important:
There is a known pattern of registers rebooting due to power failure. Software
logs showing "Terminals scheduled for reload" mean a trigger was created, not
that terminals are rebooting immediately.

Cause
-----
Software updates that include register reloads are triggered after a controller
unexpectedly reboots or is manually rebooted by the store, KSC, or third party.

Reloads are usually scheduled for non-business hours to avoid disruption.

If the controller restarts during the day, the update and reload process may
start early, causing registers to reboot unexpectedly.

Resolution
----------
1. Check the controller system messages to determine if the controller restarted
   unexpectedly or if there was a power outage.
   - Confirm with the store if there was a power failure, technician activity,
     or manual reboot.
   - Contact Frontend Tier 2 for assistance if needed.

2. Check the Software.log for POS software downloads or updates.
   - Look for dates, updates, and indications that a 9-load was sent to lanes.
   - Frontend Tier 2 can assist interpreting the log.

3. Understand that software updates may trigger reloads even if a 9-load is not
   explicitly mentioned.

4. Registers IPL/reload/restart after signing off is likely caused by these
   updates.

5. Advise the store to sign off only a few registers at a time to reduce lag.

6. Note that once the reload process starts, it cannot be stopped or undone.
   This is a side effect of the software update process.
