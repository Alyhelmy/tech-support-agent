------------------------------------------------------------
Description:
Individual or multiple SCO (Self Checkout) lanes are running slowly or having performance issues.

Examples:
- Lanes run slow while scanning items
- Lanes run slow after hitting “Pay Now”

------------------------------------------------------------
Cause:
- Software-related issues
- Hardware malfunctions

------------------------------------------------------------
Resolution Steps:

1. Identify the scope:
   - Verify which specific SCO lanes are having issues (include non-SCO lanes if affected).

2. Check for network issues:
   - Confirm whether the store is facing any network issues.
   - Look for open network-related tickets.

3. Review background controller messages:
   - Check if any SCO controllers were recently rebooted.

4. Document details:
   - Note exactly what function is slow (e.g., Opening, Closing, Scanning Items, Alt ID entry, Pay Now, Payment).

   - If slowness is related to specific hardware (e.g., scanner, printer), troubleshoot that device per its KB/documentation.

5. Network Troubleshooting:
   - Use PSY > Lookup > “Self Checkout” to list SCO lanes.
   - Ping affected lanes and compare latency with unaffected lanes.
   - If higher latency is detected, escalate to **KSC-Store Support** for switch troubleshooting (include MAC & IP addresses).

6. Perform a 9-load:
   - Ensure the SCO lane is closed.
   - Send a **9-load** from the SCO controller.

7. Document:
   - Note the steps taken and the outcome (resolved/unresolved).

8. Resolution:
   - If resolved, close the ticket.
   - If unresolved, gather escalation details.

------------------------------------------------------------
Required Information for Escalation:

1. What exactly is running slowly? At what transaction point (e.g., scan, pay)?
2. Capture extract and terminal dump for affected lanes:
   - Reference: “Toshiba SCO - MISC - How To Perform and Prepare Terminal or TCU”
3. Document all troubleshooting/resolution steps taken.
4. Escalation Path:
   - Contact **Frontend Tier 2** to escalate to **APP-POS**
   - Severity:
     - **Sev 3** for isolated terminal issues
     - **Sev 2** if all terminals in a cluster are affected
