**Description:**  
The QueVision monitor is displaying correctly for open registers and action now, but shows **0** for the 30-minute forecast.

---

**Cause:**  
The store has not completed its initial data collection phase.  
- After QueVision installation, the system requires several **weeks of data collection** before generating accurate predictions.  
- During this phase, the monitors should remain powered off.  
- Any forecast data presented during this period is unreliable and should not be used for action planning.

---

**Resolution:**

1. **Determine Go Live Date:**
   - Ask the store when their **go live date** is (or was).

2. **If Go Live Date Has NOT Passed:**
   - Inform store this behavior is expected.  
   - Predictions will not be reliable until the go live date.  
   - **Close the ticket** after providing clarification.

3. **If Store is in Test Week:**
   - Escalate to **APP-ISA** as **Priority 3 (P3)** to ensure the system is properly functioning by Go Live.

4. **If Go Live Date HAS Passed (or store doesnâ€™t know):**
   - Escalate the issue to **APP-ISA** as **Priority 3 (P3)**.
