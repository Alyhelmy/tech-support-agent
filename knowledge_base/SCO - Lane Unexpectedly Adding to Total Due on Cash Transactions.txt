Description:  
Lane is adding money to Cash Tender Due, sometimes up to $300–$500 extra on cash transactions, after customers press "Pay Now" and select "Cash".

Cause:  
Software "known risk" — business does not want to pursue a fix at this time.  
NOTE: Best practice is to perform overrides at the lane instead of transferring to the pay station to avoid this issue.

Resolution:  
This is a **known issue** when the following steps are performed (considered procedural):

Steps that cause the issue:  
1. Customer receives the "help is on the way" prompt for a cash tender over $200.  
2. SA transfers the transaction to the pay station instead of overriding at the lane.

Resolution Process:  
3. Issue requires Tier 2 to run **CHECZAP** to resolve.  
   - **IMPORTANT:** eBOSS nightly maintenance runs from **12:05 AM to 5:10 AM EST**. CHECZAP (Remote STC) must be run **after** this window.  
4. Inform the store of the best practice as noted above.  
5. Escalate to T2 to run CHECZAP.  

If CHECZAP fails:  
- Dispatch a tech to **STC the lane**.
