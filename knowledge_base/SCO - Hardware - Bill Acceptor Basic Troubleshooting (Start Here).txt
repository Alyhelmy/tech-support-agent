Description:  
Basic Fujitsu Bill Acceptor Troubleshooting.  
Note: Toshiba Hardware (System 6) does not use a bill acceptor in stores currently – only a Recycler/Bill Handler – this KB is not applicable to System 6.

Cause:  
- Wrinkled, old, or damaged bills get jammed in the bill acceptor  
- Bill acceptor stops accepting or rejects bills  
- Physical damage  

Resolution:  

Start Here: Initial Assessment  
Questions to ask / note in the ticket:  
- Are coins being accepted, but bills are not?  
- Does the lane accept bills but not deduct from the total due?  
- What color is the indicator light on the bill acceptor when it should be accepting bills?  

Determine the Error in Cash Maintenance:  
1. Have user go to: Shopper Assist Mode > Cash Maintenance > Cash Maintenance  
2. Touch the component in error to get the exact error message  
3. Touch the error message – troubleshooting info will display  
4. Begin troubleshooting as per the message  
5. If bill acceptor still not working and light is off or not green, reseat the vault (see below)
