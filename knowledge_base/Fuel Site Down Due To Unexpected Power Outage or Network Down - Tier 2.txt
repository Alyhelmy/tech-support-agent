Fuel Site Down Due To Unexpected Power Outage or Network Down
KB0012790 – Latest Version
=======================================

DESCRIPTION:
------------
Unexpected power outage occurred in the Fuel Center.

- Power may be completely out or only partial power (e.g., canopy lights may still be on).
- The main store may have full power or be running on a generator.
- Fuel Center typically does NOT have generator backup.

RESOLUTION:
-----------
**IMPORTANT:** If the Fuel Center is completely down (unable to pump gas or serve customers), WARM TRANSFER to **Frontend Tier 2**.

- If the site has been hard down for over 30 minutes, contact **KMA Fuel Lead**.
  (See: "POS/FUEL Division Contacts – KSC USE ONLY")

1. Ask the site:
----------------
- Are they able to service customers?
  - Do pumps have power? Can they dispense fuel?

    Note: If power just returned, have them press the **green reset button** to bring pumps back online.
    (See: *Basic Pump Troubleshooting*)  
    → If pumps don’t come back up, transfer to **Frontend Tier 2**.

- Do any kiosk devices have power?
  (e.g., Site server, POS, Panther, EPC, Veeder Root)

- Can you ping any devices in the Fuel Center?
  - Which devices respond?
  - Which devices do **not**?

- Is the **Oneac or APC** (battery backup) powered on?
  - Lights/beeping? (This may mean it's on battery power or there's a hardware issue.)
  - See: *UPS/Oneac Alarming in Fuel Center* for additional help.

→ Always check breakers if site has no or partial power.

2. If CASH transactions are working:
------------------------------------
→ Issue may be network related.

- Locate the **Fuel Switch**:
  - Use **TUNA** to confirm model/type.
  - Check switch status:
    - Are **green lights flashing**?
    - Is the **Fault light** on?
    - Is the device completely off?

→ Try power cycling or pressing the **RESET** button (small hole in front; use a paperclip or pen tip).

**NOTE:** If the switch cannot be located and power is NOT the issue, call **KMA Fuel Lead** for further help.

3. If power is out or partial:
------------------------------
- Instruct site to call their **power company** for an estimated restoration time.
- Call main store:
  - Are they on full power or generator?
- Ask about surrounding area (other outages).

4. After all troubleshooting:
-----------------------------
- If power outage is confirmed and Division Fuel Lead notified (or ETM chat used):
  - Instruct site to **call back** once full power is restored.
    → We must verify device recovery and check for further issues.

→ **Send incident to Frontend Tier 2** for:
   - Monitoring
   - Possible callback

**Reminder:** If unsure whether issue is network or power, consult **Frontend Tier 2**.
