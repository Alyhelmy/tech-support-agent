Error "IOPROC B000 Required File" on POS Registers  

ID: KB0011448  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description:
The registers display "IOPROC B000 Required File" and will not load.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Resolution:

1. If half or more of the registers are affected, warm transfer the call to Frontend Tier 2.  
   - If less than half the registers are affected, verify the connection to both controllers.  
   - If you cannot connect to one or both controllers, warm transfer the call to Frontend Tier 2.

2. If only a few registers display "B000 Required File Error", hard load the affected registers.

3. If the error does not clear after the reboot, troubleshoot possible network issues.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Frontend Tier 2:

1. If all registers are down with B000 Required File, verify that there are no network issues.  
   - If there are network issues, contact KSC - Store Support for assistance as needed.

2. Instruct the user to power off the registers showing "offline" lights and leave them off.  
   - If the other registers begin to load, power on the powered-off registers one at a time.

3. If the registers still do not load:  
   - Refer to: POS Controller - Not Able To Access D Drive On MC  
   - Check for controller hardware/software issues.  
   - If that is not the issue, try powering off the CC Controller and leave it off temporarily to see if the registers recover.  
   - Power the CC back on and monitor behavior.  
     - You may need to power cycle the registers again for them to recover.  
     - When troubleshooting, check the messages on all controllers. If they show different messages, this may indicate a communication problem.  
       - Try IPLing the MC to resolve the issue.

4. If the registers still do not recover:  
   - During business hours: engage APP-POS via chat for assistance.  
   - After hours: transfer the incident to APP-POS, Priority 2.
