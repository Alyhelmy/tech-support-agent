**Description:**  
Explains the cause and resolution of the **UNITDIED** error related to a faulty lane sensor.  
🔧 This error is auto-reported to MOM via SNMP, generating an **Infra ticket**.  
If the store reports a detector issue, check the **KSC job queue** for an auto-generated ticket.

---

**Cause:**  
A node sensor connected to a master sensor (via Controller Area Network - CAN) is not functioning properly.  
This is detected by the SDI at boot or upon malfunction.

---

**Resolution:**

1. Open a browser and enter:  
   `http://sdi.xx###` or the **SDI IP Address** listed in **TUNA**  
   *(Replace `xx` with division and `###` with store number)*

2. Verify if **SDI time is correct and advancing**  
   - Refresh if needed  
   - ❌ If NOT advancing → escalate to **APP-ISA**, Severity 3  
   - ✅ If advancing → continue

3. Click the **system error** message in the upper-left of the SDI screen

4. Record relevant **Help Center** info in the ticket

5. Go to:  
   **Support Center > Basic Support > Unit Status**  
   - Username: `support`  
   - Password: `suPPoR7`

6. Monitor **Unit Status page**:
   - If all sensors show ✅ green checks, **wait 1 minute**  
   - If still error-free, **link this document and close the ticket**  
   - If error reappears, proceed

7. Identify and note the **register number** linked to the malfunctioning node sensor  
   - Example: CAN ID 2 in error under master sensor CAN ID 1 = Register 7

8. Record the **LED status** for the sensor

9. Escalate to **APP-ISA**, Severity 3
