Description
-----------
The cash drawer may fail to open, close, or trigger properly during use.

Cause
-----
Cash drawers are connected to the POS register via an ethernet cable and triggered by a solenoid. Common issues:
- Physical jam (e.g., coin rolled under tray)
- Solenoid failure
- Drawer accidentally locked
- Damage to drawer rails
- Controller error message regarding hardware

Resolution
----------

Inspect the Drawer
------------------
- Check for any visible obstructions such as coins or debris.
- Gently tapping the front may release a jammed drawer.
- Manually use a **key** to open the drawer if available.
‚ö†Ô∏è Do NOT attempt to pry open with tools ‚Äî this may cause damage.

Check Solenoid Function
-----------------------
1. Press hand against drawer while triggering open to feel for solenoid activation (a kick/click).
2. If no response:
   - Check cable connection on both the **drawer** and **base unit**.
   - Power off the register and **reseat** the cable.
3. Look behind the cash till insert for a **green power light**.
4. If it kicks but won‚Äôt open:
   - Check lock orientation ‚Äî must be **vertical** (unlocked).
   - Even slightly turned can engage lock.
   - Some locks may be replaced with a plug.
5. Still won‚Äôt open and no key available:
   - **Dispatch** per NIMS Parts List.

üö® New Note:
- If **cash is stuck inside**, ask the manager if they wish to increase **severity to 2** (8-hour response). 
- A **severity 1** gets 4-hour service.
- **Include this in dispatch notes.**

Check Rails on the Drawer
--------------------------
1. Remove cash till, extend drawer, and **inspect rails**.
2. Drawer should extend and retract freely.
   - Check both rails are properly latched.
   - Reseat drawer: lift slightly and slide onto tabs.
3. If rails are damaged:
   - **Dispatch** per NIMS Parts List.

Hardware Error in Controller Messages
-------------------------------------
1. Power off the register.
2. Reseat ethernet cable at drawer and register.
3. Power back on.
4. If error remains:
   - **Dispatch** per NIMS Parts List.
   - Refer to: *KSC Hardware Dispatching For All Pillars*

Drawer Keys Request
-------------------
- Refer to **Loss Prevention Manager** or **Local Division Office**.
- For **LO Division**, refer to **Service Hub**.

Terminal Locked / Can't Sign Off
--------------------------------
If terminal is locked and can't sign off:
- Use **Terminal Transfer** or **Force Log Off**.
- See: *How to Transfer Operator from a Failed Terminal (Terminal Transfer)*
