B076 - Authorization Required Or B076 - Authorization Required - Fuel Points Not Available
The person signed into the Fuel POS is either using an ID created to use with the in-store registers, or they are a new hire and their ID was not set up correctly. ID's for Fuel Clerks must be created with a level 3. You can look their operator ID up on the MC.

See How To Check Operator ID's in ACE and Authorization Levels and SCO Lanes

1. Refer the clerk to the store's File Maintenance person or Manager.

  a. If a store clerk filling in at the fuel center, they need to have a new ID created.

  b. If a new hire, their ID MUST be deleted, then a new one created with a level 3.

 

Creating a new ID is procedural and must be done at the store

 

Note: If there are no IDs available for the site to use that give proper loyalty discounts and there is no one at the store who can create a level 3 profile for the site to use, then contact the Fuel Division lead per K3498 Division Contacts / Miscellaneous Contacts

 

If the fuel clerk is unable to clear this ACE message or proceed with the transaction:

1. Send a 9 load to the register (see register reboot entry).

  - Note: POS1 is terminal 100, POS2 is terminal 101, etc.

2. After the register recovers from the reboot, the clerk will be able to clear the transaction and proceed.
