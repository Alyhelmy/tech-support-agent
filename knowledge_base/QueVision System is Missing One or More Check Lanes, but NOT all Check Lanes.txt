QueVision System is Missing One or More Check Lanes, but NOT all Check Lanes  
**Document ID:** KB0011721  
**Views:** 24

**Description:**  
Some (but NOT all) registers do not appear in the QueVision system or drop off the dashboard intermittently.

---

**Cause:**  
DO NOT REBOOT the SDI unless it is completely unresponsive or not pinging.  
- Rebooting the SDI clears log files and may lead to incorrect reporting or SDI failure.  
- The most common cause of this issue is inactivity. After 5 minutes without a transaction, a signed-on register may drop off the dashboard.

---

**Resolution:**

1. **Check for Timeout Events:**  
   - Access SDI → Support Center Tab → Log in with Confidential Password.  
   - Check the error log for timeout warnings.  
   - When a transaction resumes, the warning clears and the register reappears on the dashboard.

2. **New or Moved Lanes:**  
   - New lanes require new overhead sensors.  
   - This is handled via a QueVision work request initiated by the Division Technology Lead (DTL).  
   - Refer store to their DTL if sensors are not yet installed.

3. **Manual Register Check:**  
   - At affected lanes: unsecure terminal → sign off → sign back on.  
   - If still not visible, proceed with next steps.

4. **EPOS Viewer (SDI Web Interface):**  
   - Go to Support Center > Log into Basic Support.  
   - Check for “LaneEvent” or “TransactionEvent” logs.  
   - If dashboard shows lanes 1–5, but logs show activity on lanes 6–10, this suggests lanes were renumbered.  
     → Escalate to **APP-ISA (P3)** with note that lanes were renumbered.

5. **No Logs for Affected Lane:**  
   - If no event messages for the specific lane, but other lanes show logs, proceed with troubleshooting.  
   - If **no lanes** have event messages, see: *QueVision Showing Zeros on the Dashboard (Circles)* or *Missing ALL Checklanes*.

6. **Send a 9-load to the Register(s):**  
   - See: *How to Reboot Register or Load Terminal Configuration (9 Load)*.  
   - If errors appear, troubleshoot using appropriate documentation.  
   - After reboot, sign in and scan items.  
   - Wait a few minutes and check for new event logs in EPOS Viewer.

**Escalation Guidelines:**

- If **Difsrvc** is not working properly on the POS controller, escalate to **APP-POS**.  
  - If affecting **≥50%** of registers: escalate as **P2**.  
  - Follow: *Unable to write to Disk Queue: DIFSRVCE is not processing properly*.  

- If issue is SDI/QueVision-related:  
  - Escalate to **APP-ISA**.  
  - If affecting **≥50%** of registers: escalate as **P3**.
