SCO - D75 Lane Touchscreen Not Responding to Touch

Document ID: KB0011212

---

Synopsis:
Casing: Genesis only.  
Touch screen fails to register touch points on screen.

---

Cause:
Hardware

---

Resolution:

Note: Recently there has been an issue where SCO touchscreens are not responding and they have a cursor/pointer on the screen that will follow the finger but will not select the buttons to open the lane.  
- Check/troubleshoot the receipt printer to make sure it's functioning and try reloading.  
- If the issue persists, have Tier 2 run CHECZAP on the lanes.  
- If the lane still will not open after CHECZAP, dispatch a tech to STC the lane and ensure the tech reformats the drive.

This document is only to be used for Genesis D75 monitors on the SCO lanes.

**Monitor Type Guidance:**
- D25 Monitor → DO NOT use this document (Use KB K15420 - D25 Lane Touchscreen Not Responding to Touch)
- D75 Monitor → USE this document

Steps:

1. Document monitor type (D25 or D75) in ticket notes.

2. Verify Scale/Scanner is still functioning (scan item and see if it shows on the screen) to ensure this isn't a lane freeze.  
   - Note scanner status in the ticket.  
   - If lane screen displays "Open", have associate scan SA barcode and check if screen responds to ID/password entry.

3. If screen fails while in open state:
   - Press the TCU power button.
   - When prompted, select "Close Lane".

4. Did the "Close Lane" button respond to touch?
   - YES → Lane freeze; touchscreen is functional.
   - NO → Note this in the ticket.

5. Verify the associate has keys to access the lane (needed for physical access).

6. Open the top casing door (the part with the touchscreen).

7. Unplug and reseat the USB cable (circled).

8. Test touch functionality on the screen.

9. If screen still does not respond to touch:
   - Run the calibration script:

     a. Connect to MC.  
     b. Go to Command Mode (#7).  
     c. Type: `adxtcxxl` followed by the lane number (Example: `adxtcxxl 500`)  
     d. After running the command, send a 9-load to the lane.  
     e. Wait for calibration touch points to appear and have associate tap them.

10. Test touch response after the lane reboots.

11. If issue remains:
    - Power off the lane and UPS for at least two minutes.
    - Power back on and retest.

12. Reminder: If this matches the known touchscreen/cursor issue, have Tier 2 run remote CHECZAP before dispatching.  
    - Otherwise, dispatch per "KSC Hardware Dispatching For All Pillars."

13. If a tech calls in and cannot resolve:
    - Escalate to APP-POS (Priority 3) with extract.
    - Allow tech to leave.
