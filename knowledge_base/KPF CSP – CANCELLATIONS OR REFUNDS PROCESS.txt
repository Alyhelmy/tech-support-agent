KB0015277
====================================================================

üìå PURPOSE:
--------------
This process explains **how to cancel or refund a bill payment** in the **Customer Service Platform (CSP)**.

====================================================================
üìç COMMON REASONS FOR CANCELLATION:
-----------------------------------------
- Customer changes their mind
- System error
- Associate entry mistake

====================================================================
‚ùó KEY REMINDERS:
---------------------
- Refunds must be processed **in the same app** used to complete the transaction.
- **NOT all billers allow cancellations.**
- Cancellation eligibility is decided by the **biller**, NOT Kroger or its vendors.
- **Same-day cancellations only.** Customer must present their **original CSP receipt**.

====================================================================
‚úÖ HOW TO CANCEL A BILL PAYMENT TRANSACTION IN CSP:
--------------------------------------------------------
1. Go to the **History** tab in CSP.
2. Locate the transaction you want to cancel.
3. Review cancellation option:
   - If **Cancel** button is bright red ‚Üí Proceed with cancellation.
   - If **Cancel** is greyed out ‚Üí A message will appear: ‚ÄúCancellation is not allowed.‚Äù

üìû If Cancellation Not Allowed:
------------------------------------
4. **Contact the biller directly.**
   - Vendor phone numbers are listed on **page 31 of the Money Services Training Guide** (CSP Store Training Guide.pptx).
   - If cancellation is approved:
     - Complete a **Payment Adjustment Form** and send it to the vendor.
     - If unsure where to get the form, contact the **store manager**.

====================================================================
üì¶ REFUND HANDLING:
------------------------
- Refunds are sent to the **store via RASC**, **not** directly from the vendor.
- Refund timeline:
   - **Contracted (Same-Day) billers:** ~3 business days.
   - **Non-Contracted billers:** Up to **30 days**, no guarantee.

‚õî "Making it Right" or refunding directly to the customer is up to **store policy**.
   - KSC does **not** provide advice on store-level refunds.

====================================================================
