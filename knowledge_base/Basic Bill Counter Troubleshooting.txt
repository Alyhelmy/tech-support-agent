Bill Counter/Jetscan Troubleshooting  

Cause  
-----  
If there are bills in the Jetscan when they try to ** (finalize), they get an error message.  
This message prevents transactions from finalizing without accounting for all cash.  
If it locks them out from finalizing when no bills are present, check the sensor and clean the bill counter to ensure it's not causing the issue.

1. Try reseating the USB cable ("horseshoe cable") on the rear of the "Lenovo" PC.  
2. Power off bill counter (power button on back above power cable).  
3. Reseat Ethernet cable connected to back of bill counter and ensure connection to VeriBalance PC (DB9 Serial).

   - If horizontal, use port closest to power switch.  
4. Turn bill counter back on.  
5. On VeriBalance PC, click Utilities > Setup > Hardware.  
   - Status should display "H:0 S:0 M:0".  
   - If blank or off, ensure bill counter is NOT in "Verify" mode. Switch off "Verify" mode to communicate again.  
   - "Verify" is a small light with a push button under it (or touch screen button on new machines). Press button to toggle light.  
   - For "add" mode, press "End BAT" then "Add" again.
