Is offline manual authorization allowed? No

 

We do not take them offline in lock up situations for any cards except Platinum Cards.

 

Can these cards be tendered as cash? Yes, if there is an approval in payment systems and no reversal…follow the steps below.

 

Reversal Example:


Both the Credit Purchase and Credit Rev Purchase say Approved, Kroger has released the funds back to the Customer's Card and the card should be attempted again, questions should be refered to Customer's Bank.

Credit Purchase says Approved, but Credit Rev Purchase says Declined, Reversal did not go through and transaction should be rung as cash.

If only a Purchase is showing, and there is no matching Reversal showing transaction should be rang as cash.
