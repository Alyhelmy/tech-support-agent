Description
-----------
Registers may not load past:
- PXE
- U001
- U003
- U005.4

Symptoms:
- “Media Test Failure, Check Cable”
- “No Boot Source Found, Retrying…”
- “B073 NOT AVAILABLE OFFLINE”

Note:  
If **multiple registers** are affected and lane switches are pinging → **considered store down**. Escalate to **Frontend Tier 2**.

Cause
-----
- Register is not connected to the in-store network
- Bad NIC port on register system board
- Damaged Ethernet cable, drop, or switch port
- Fuel sites: DHCP snooping misconfigured or lease issue

Resolution
----------

1. **Check Register’s Lane Switch:**
   - Use **PSY** or **TUNA** to determine switch association.
   - In PSY: Highlight switch, check “Additional Comments” for lane number.

   If switch is **not pinging**:
   - Have associate check if the switch under the check stand is powered.
   - Reboot it (disconnect and reconnect power).
   - If switch does not power on, check power strip or switch.

   If it still doesn’t ping → dispatch per **NIMS Parts List**.

2. **Find the Register’s Switch via Netmapper:**
   - In PSY: Web Apps > Netmapper > Blue Netmapper
   - Login with: `EUID` | Password: `kr####` (last 4 of EUID)
   - Use CTRL+F to search for: `pinpad-###` (e.g., pinpad-030)
   - Note the switch ID (e.g., hp2530sw1)
   - Open **TUNA** → Management → F9 → Find switch
   - Highlight and F5 → Login → enter "menu"
   - Go to: 
     - 1. Status and Counters
     - Port Counters
     - Show Details

   If **Drop Tx** or **Collisions Tx** are rising → indicates a network issue.

3. **Reseat Ethernet Cable**:
   - Power off the register.
   - Reseat the cable from register to switch.
   - Power on and observe if it loads properly.

4. **Re-add MAC Address in Whitelist**:
   - See doc: *How to Add a POS Register to TUNA*

5. **Try Alternate Port on Switch**:
   - Move Ethernet cable to another port.
   - Reload register.
   - If unresolved: Dispatch via *KSC Hardware Dispatching*.
     - Tech should test/replace:
       - Network cable
       - Switch port
       - Entire switch if needed

Note:  
Fuel site switches may be located in IDF cabinets. Some divisions (e.g., Cincinnati) lack access—dispatch needed.
