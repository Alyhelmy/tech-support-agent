Graphics / Artwork
------------------
1. If the Graphics/Artwork is incorrect on the register screen, try restarting the register.
2. Walk the store user through Ctrl+Alt+Delete and select Restart.
3. If this does not work, send your incident to App-Merch-ORE2.0-Jewelry Sev 3.

Register Troubleshooting
------------------------
Note: Include in the title of your incident the Register Number found in the lower right-hand corner of the GemStore Screen.

Note: When any device has been hot swapped, a full shutdown/restart must be performed.

Anytime a register needs to be rebooted, please stay on with the store until the register comes back up or call them back to verify it is back up and working. 
Do not just close the ticket.

If both Reg 1 and 2 are down, this is considered a store down and must be treated as such. 
If you can't get them up and running, you must go through Frontend Tier 2 to page App-Merch-ORE2.0-Jewelry Sev. 2.

1. Verify that the register has power.
   - Have store try powering register on from power button.

If register does not have power, check the following and document in ticket:
   - What is the register plugged into? e.g., Power Strip or Wall Outlet?  
     - If power strip, verify other devices plugged into it have power.
     - If power strip has open port, plug register into that.
   - If wall outlet, verify it is clean power (e.g., orange outlet).
     - Plug something else in to verify outlet is good.
     - Try another outlet if nearby.
   - Verify power cable is plugged in fully at both ends.
   - Have user hold power button for 10 seconds, pushing all the way in.
   - Did the store have a power surge?
   - Verify no one is flipping a breaker that powers the register off.

2. Does the register monitor display message "No OS Found"?
   - If yes, reboot register and try again.
   - If unresolved, register will need replacement. See Dispatching Section.

3. For peripheral device issues: Reseat cable and perform shutdown/restart on register.
   For additional info, see device-specific docs.

4. If register freezes during transaction, see these docs:
   - Jewelry: Verifone pinpad locks up in transaction
   - Jewelry: Freezes or server offline message during transaction or customer search

Verify receipt printer and pinpad are working properly.

5. After restarting, if issues persist, capture this info in your ticket:
   - Register model # (e.g., Lenovo M93p)
   - Asset # on register (e.g., KR#103996)
   - Check for system restarts using GSI "Show Reboots" button.
   - How long has problem existed?
   - Is machine dirty?
   - Is the fan on?
   - Is register warm to touch?
   - Has store had power issues?
   - Is store remodeling?
   - Is this register an island register?
   - Any error messages on register?

Check Peripheral Port Settings
------------------------------
Navigate to:
  Support - GSI, on the Menu Launcher. Log in with a PPM User ID and Password.

  - Select DEVICE MANAGER > PORTS (COM & LPT)
  - Right-click device > PROPERTIES
  - Choose PORT SETTINGS tab
  - Click ADVANCED button
  - Use drop-down menu at COM Port Number to select correct port for each device
  - Click OK twice and close Device Manager
  - Close GemStore and other windows, then reboot register

Device Port Settings Examples
-----------------------------
  - Prolific USB-to-Serial COMM Port (COM2) — Pinpad
  - USB Serial Port A776 (COM9) — Printer
  - Intel Active Technology Management (COM6)
  - Honeywell Control Device - Handscanner (under USB Controllers)

If store has no operational register, page App-Merch-ORE2.0-Jewelry with Moderate/Limited Impact, High Urgency ticket.

If store has another functioning register, send low urgency ticket to App-Merch-ORE2.0-Jewelry.

Lenovo M93p Specifics
---------------------
This is an ultra-small form-factor PC (slightly larger than a paperback novel).

Differences from Dell model:
  - No serial port for pinpad; uses serial module with bracket and USB patch cable.
    See doc 12870.
  - Different power cable due to lack of internal power supply.
  - Power cable and patch cable are not interchangeable with previous register cables.

The patch cable is sensitive; movement may cause peripherals to lose communication.

To check communication:
1. Support - GSI on Menu Launcher
2. Login with PPM User ID and Password
3. Device Manager > Ports (COM & LPT)
4. If devices don’t show, reseat patch cable
5. Restart if needed
