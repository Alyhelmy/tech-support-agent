Jewelry: Missing Transactions  
KB0011730
===============================================================================

Description
-----------
Store associate reports they cannot locate a POS transaction in GemStore.  
Assistance is needed to investigate the details and status of the transaction.

===============================================================================
Known Causes
------------
1. Incorrect or insufficient search details provided by associate.
2. Associate searched in Transaction History instead of Layaway/Special Order Maintenance.
3. Suspended transactions not recalled before end of day are auto-cancelled by POS.
4. FMJ.com/LTJ.com refunds (qty 2+) via Customer History will fail — use manual refund.
5. Store21 transactions failed to port into Gemstore if missing:
   - Last Name (1+ characters)
   - Street (1+ characters)

===============================================================================
Resolution Steps
----------------

▶ Preliminary Research

1. **Open one ticket per missing transaction.**

2. **Gather detailed transaction info**, and record in ticket or screenshots:
   - Transaction Date
   - Transaction Number
   - Transaction Amount
   - Transaction Type (Sale, Layaway, Refund, etc.)
   - Last 4 digits of payment card
   - Customer Info (name, phone, address)
   - Register number
   - Whether the store has a receipt

> Note: If no receipt was printed, the transaction likely did **not go through**.  
> Store should **re-ring** the sale.

3. **Search support tools**, based on gathered data:
   - **Transaction Log tool** – Search Customer History
   - **VSM**:
     - Sale: Cash Functions → Till Audit Reports → Receipt Enquiry
     - Layaway: Reports → Layaway Report
     - Special Order: Reports → Special Order Report
   - **Payment Systems (EPS)** – for credit/debit transactions

> If issue involves **store inventory**, refer associate to **Inventory Control specialist**.

▶ Escalation
- Send P3 ticket to: `App-Merch-ORE2.0-Jewelry`  
- Title: **Missing Transaction**
- All escalations **must go through Frontend Tier 2** before forwarding.

Missing Layaway Payment (Known Defect)
---------------------------------------

Problem: Customer makes payment on layaway, but payment appears missing during next payment.

Steps:
1. Confirm payment exists in **Transaction Log tool (Customer History)**.
2. If tender = credit, debit, or gift card, verify approval in **Payment Systems**.
   - If verified:
     - Major CC / Gift Card → Re-tender as **cash**
     - Platinum → Register must be taken offline to re-tender to card
3. Email `fmjsalesaudit@fredmeyerjewelers.com` with:
   - Store Number
   - Date
   - Customer Name
   - Layaway Number
   - Payment Amount
   - Original Tender Type
   - Ticket Number
   - Instructions provided to store
   - What the store wants done
   - Attach payment systems screenshots
4. Store must fill out **Cash Drawer Error Form** if re-rang as cash.
