How to Readdress a Register and Verify Load Definition

Document ID: KB0011410  


---

Synopsis:  
- Register displays "Welcome to IBM Point of Sale", "Z001", or "W662 Duplicate Terminal # Detected" (i.e. incorrect lane address)  
- Lane only shows Fuel/POS interface  
- The register # may not be set up in ACE  
- The register address may be "zeroed out" and needs to be re-entered  
- Check for available register addresses (Terminal IDs) on MC Controller  

---

Solution:

**Important Notes:**  
- If multiple registers need to be readdressed, contact the division office to confirm that register addresses exist in controller load definitions.  
- The dump switch cannot be used on a 777 terminal—follow the steps below.  
- Make sure any active operators are signed off the affected terminals before proceeding.

**Readdress 4800 Register (if terminal is active on LAN):**

1. Tap 3x in the lower-left corner, then 1x in the lower-right corner to access the 10-key, S1, and S2.  
2. Tap S1 → enter `71` → tap S2.  
3. Address register to terminal 0: enter `1000` → tap S2.  
4. Register will reboot and display `Z001`.  
5. Enter the correct terminal number: `10##` → tap S2.

**Readdress 4800 Register (Double Dump Procedure - if terminal was never addressed):**

1. Press the dump switch (pen or paperclip).  
   - **4800/741**: Located under the “R” symbol.

2. When `U008` displays, turn terminal OFF (ensure no printer lights).  
3. Turn terminal ON.  
4. When `U005` displays, press the dump switch again.  
   - Display will still show `U005`.  

5. Tap 3x lower-left, 1x lower-right to access 10-key, S1, and S2.  
6. When `0000` displays:  
   - Enter terminal ID: `1XXX` → tap S2  
   - Example:  
     - `1030` = Terminal 30  
     - `1001` = Terminal 1  
     - `1280` = Terminal 280  

   - To correct mistakes: Use S1 to clear.

**Note:** No error will show if the wrong terminal number is entered. If wrong, "Z012 Configuration Complete" will still display and lane will continue to load.

7. Sign on to the terminal.  
8. Verify new terminal ID:  
   - Tap 3x lower-left, 1x lower-right  
   - Enter: S1 → `7` → S2

**Readdressing a 777 Terminal:**

1. During boot, watch for `U050 Clear Terminal Number` (briefly appears).  
2. Press **Clear** to begin renumbering.  
3. Enter the new terminal number when prompted.

**Tech Note:**  
To display `U050` earlier, connect USB keyboard and hold **F12** while booting.

**Frontend Tier 2 Notes:**  
Refer to the document “Kroger Terminal Addresses” for Enterprise standards if needed.

**Verify Terminal Address Availability:**

1. Connect to the Master Controller.  
2. Go to: `4. Installation and Upgrade Aids`  
3. Select: `1. Change Configuration Data`  
4. Choose: `5. Generic Terminal Configuration` (may take time to load)  
5. Highlight **Load Definitions** → press Enter  
6. Press Tab twice → select `[ ] Group Identical Load Definitions` → press Enter  
7. Page down through register ranges.  
8. Compare terminal in question to nearby working terminals:

   - **Example 1:**  
     - Register 16 has issues; 15 and 14 are fine  
     - Range 1–29 exists → 16 should share same config

   - **Example 2:**  
     - Register 66 has issues; 65 and 67 are fine  
     - Group: 65, 67, 300 → 66 is in a separate config

   - SCO lanes with static IPs are always listed individually.

9. Press F3 repeatedly to return to the ACE Main Menu.  
10. If terminal has different load definition, rebuild using **Terminal Installer** or **Checuser**.
