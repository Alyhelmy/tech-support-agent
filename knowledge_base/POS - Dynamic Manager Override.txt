POS - Dynamic Manager Override
KB0012656
=======================================

DESCRIPTION:
------------
Dynamic override is a printable barcode linked to cashier number, date, and time. It is used to complete all overrides.

- The barcode can be printed from any register (EXCEPT SCO lanes and Fuel Registers. Paystations are OK).

CAUSE:
------
- Barcodes expire after 2 hours.
- Barcodes are purged at the end of the sales day.

PROCESS FOR PRINTING:
---------------------
Touchscreen:
→ Press **Print Manager Barcode** at the bottom  
→ Enter **Cashier number**  
→ Enter **Password**

TO PERFORM AN OVERRIDE:
------------------------
Touchscreen:
→ Scan override barcode when prompted.

RESOLUTION:
-----------
Note: For **single user issues**, Dynamic Override options are base level.

- If all troubleshooting has been done, advise store manager (or whoever manages ACE) to delete and recreate the user profile.

- Always test on **odd and even numbered registers** to rule out controller-specific issues.
  - MC/SD = Odd registers
  - CC = Even registers

**IMPORTANT:** Dynamic Overrides require the **Acting Master Controller** to be online and synced with other controllers.

→ To check:
  - Login to Acting Master Controller  
  - Press `~` (tilde), then:
    - C > 2 (Controller Functions)
    - 1 (Display Controller Status)
    - Page Down through results

- If any controllers are “Inactive,” it's a sync/communication issue.
- Coldboot the controller if it’s not offline.
- If offline, FE Tier 2 will troubleshoot.

**File Access Errors (B040):**
- Instruct Frontend Tier 2 to **coldboot the acting master controller**.
- If only some registers affected, coldboot the related controller and terminals.
- This is due to file lock or controller sync issue.

---------------------------------------------------
ISSUE: BARCODE WILL NOT PRINT
---------------------------------------------------
1. User must have **Level 6 or higher** in ACE Operator Authorization.
   → Have store manager verify authorization level.

2. If confirmed Level 6:
   → Recreate the issue (steps taken vs expected result)
   → Call **Frontend Tier 2** to escalate to **APP-POS**
     - Escalate as **P3** for single barcode/operator
     - Escalate as **P2** if entire store is affected

---------------------------------------------------
BARCODE WON'T PRINT IN PHARMACY / CUSTOMER SERVICE
BUT PRINTS ON FRONT END REGISTERS
---------------------------------------------------
1. Confirm barcode prints at Front End but not at Pharmacy/CS.

2. **Warm Transfer** to Frontend Tier 2.

→ Frontend Tier 2: See **"POS - Dynamic Barcodes Will Not Print At Pharmacy Registers But Will Print At FE Registers"**

---------------------------------------------------
B6 KEYED DATA OUT OF RANGE
---------------------------------------------------
- The Override key must be pressed **before** scanning barcode.
→ Have user press **Override**, then scan.

---------------------------------------------------
B287 MO BARCODE EXPIRED
---------------------------------------------------
- When a new barcode is created, the previous one is deleted.
- Using the old one causes B287 error.

1. Instruct user to discard old barcode and reprint.
2. If new barcode also fails:
   → Recreate issue steps
   → Call **Frontend Tier 2**
3. Warm transfer to Frontend Tier 2:
   → Coldboot each controller to resync communication
4. If not resolved, escalate to **APP-POS**
   - Escalate as **P3** for single operator
   - Escalate as **P2** if all are affected
   - INCLUDE affected user's **ID number** in the incident’s Security field

---------------------------------------------------
B149 INVALID ENTRY
---------------------------------------------------
Occurs when override barcode creation fails.
Message gives reason code 1–4:

1. Invalid or unreadable Operator Authorization file / invalid Operator ID
   - Check for valid **7-digit EUID**
   - Verify it is added to **Operator Authorization Records > Password**

2. Password mismatch
   - Have associate confirm or change password.

3. Operator Level invalid
   - Must be **Level 6 or higher**

4. EUID not valid
   - Must be added to **Operator Authorization Records > Password**

→ Validate ACE setup for associate:
   - Correct EUID
   - Level 6+
   - Operator ID (3-4 digit number, **not** EUID)

→ If valid, escalate via Tier 2 to **APP-POS P3** (or **P2** for storewide issue)
   - Always include Operator ID (APP-POS cannot search by EUID)

---------------------------------------------------
NOTE ON GENERIC IDS
---------------------------------------------------
If store uses Generic IDs or is trying to set one up:
→ **KSC does not support these**
→ Refer store to **Division POS DTL (Division Technology Lead)**

---------------------------------------------------
ADD EUID TO ACE OPERATOR ID (STORE RESPONSIBILITY)
---------------------------------------------------
KSC can verify but does NOT add. Steps for store:

1. Login to MC controller
2. Press 1 - ACE Main Menu
3. Go to Data Maintenance
4. Select Operator Authorization Records
5. Enter Operator ID
6. Enter Associate's EUID
7. Set Level to 6 or higher
8. Save changes

→ If adding new IDs, they must be modeled after existing IDs AND include valid EUID

→ See: *How to Check Operator ID’s in ACE and Authorization Levels*

→ See: *POS/FUEL Division Contacts – KSC USE ONLY*
