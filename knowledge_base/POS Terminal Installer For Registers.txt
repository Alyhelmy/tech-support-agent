Resolution Steps:

Before Running Terminal Installer:
1. DO NOT run on SCO lanes or HT Fuel Center registers.
2. Verify that ADXCSCOL is NOT running (` + B).
3. Confirm register model with store associate (needed for Enhanced status).
4. Ensure enough “Cash Register” entries exist in TUNA (use F9 to sort).

Run Terminal Installer:
1. Go to ACE Main Menu > User Procedures > Misc Reports & Utils > Terminal Installer.
2. Answer the prompts:
   - Register number
   - Confirmation for type (Frontend, Fuel, SCO Pay Station)
   - Full-screen customer display (Y/N)

Ticket Template (copy/paste into ticket):
REG #: ___
Terminal Type: [Frontend / Fuel / SCO Paystation]
Full-Screen Display: [Yes / No]

Manual Activation (if TI fails):
1. Go to System Main Menu > 4. Installation and Update Aids
2. Select: 1. Change Configuration Data > 4. Activate Configuration > 1. Terminal Configuration
3. Wait for success/failure. Look for “F10” prompt for system messages.

Send Load Command:
1. Press ` + C
2. Select 1. Terminal Functions > 9 > Enter
3. Confirm register reloads or goes black.
4. If no response, power cycle via the TCU power button.

Special Cases:

Offsite Fuel Center:
- Prompt will warn that TI may take longer.
- Continue normally after confirmation.

Terminal Installer Disabled:
- Message: “Program error occurred” is expected.
- TI exits without changes. No action needed.

Supsleep is Running in Command Mode:
- Background fix is in progress. TI may take up to 30 minutes.
- DO NOT stop the process. Offer to call the store back.

IP Address Errors:

Messages:
- "No Free IP found. Please add some IP addresses in TUNA."
- "No IPs found in host file."

Fix:
- Add more cash register reservations in TUNA (POS/Fuel segment).
- If error persists, sync IPs from TUNA or modify comment to force host file rewrite.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Escalation Path:

E1. Complete all above steps before escalating.
E2. Treat as P2 high-severity issue.
E3. Escalate to KSC Frontend Tier 2 first.
E4. Escalate to APP-POS only if Tier 2 cannot resolve.
