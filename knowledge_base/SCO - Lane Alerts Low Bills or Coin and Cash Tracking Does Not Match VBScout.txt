Description:  
Lane is stating that the Bill/Coin Dispensers are low.  
The amounts displayed in "Cash Tracking" on the SCO Lane do not match the amounts listed in VBScout, even though the amounts in VBScout are updating/changing when money is accepted or dispensed on the lane.  

Cause:  
Procedural  

Resolution:  
Important Note:  
The “Cash Tracking” amounts on Toshiba model lanes will not update from VBScout/VeriBalance if the amounts are negative in any of the denominations.  
If this occurs, the store must zero them out and/or update them to the correct values (usually during the next full balance of the lanes) for communication with VBScout/VeriBalance to resume.  

Steps:  

1. Verify that the amounts displayed in "Cash Tracking" do not match the actual amounts in the lane or in VBScout:  
   - Have SA log into Cash Maintenance.  
   - Select Cash Tracking.  
   - Select the device at the bottom of the screen giving the warning or low message.  

2. Have the SA check for negative or low amounts.  
   - See: Toshiba SCO - SCO Lane Currency Full and Low Level Amounts  

3. Determine if the lane is physically low/out of money or if only Cash Tracking is incorrect.  
   - Physically check the cash devices.  

4. Identify the type of hardware: Toshiba System 6 or Fujitsu.  

If Toshiba System 6:  
5. The amount should update automatically when inserting bills through the bill acceptor.  
   - Confirm that the associate presses the button to "Remove All Bills from Cash Box" when removing money.  

6. Coin values will only update if inserted through the coin cup.  
   - If hoppers are used, the amounts should update when coins are loaned via VBScout.  
   - Refer associate to their division SCO trainer for proper steps.  

If Fujitsu hardware:  
7. Associate must manually adjust the amounts in Cash Tracking to match VBScout.  
   - This is procedural. Refer the store to their bookkeeper or District/Division Front End Coordinator.  
   - If alert remains after Cash Tracking is updated, reboot the lane.  
   - If amounts match VBScout and the lane has been rebooted, dispatch on the failing part (i.e., bill or coin dispenser) per NIMS.  
   - Fujitsu Techs may refer to their company as GLM (Global Lifecycle Management).  

NOTE for Fujitsu Hardware:  
The amounts in "Cash Tracking" are NOT updated automatically when loaning money via VBScout.  
Operators without access to VBScout can still update values manually.  
Whenever money is added/removed from the lane, the associate must also manually update “Cash Tracking” with these amounts.  
This is procedural — stores should be referred to the District/Division Front End Coordinator for guidance.
