Description
-----------
- Transactions are not clearing from the POS or the pump.
- Pump may display "Pump Busy".
- POS may show: “B118 No More Items” or prompt to “Refund change of $0.00” after fueling.
- Could occur alongside: *Exclamation Point On Fuel Dispenser Icon*.
- Related issue: *FUEL - Panther Troubleshooting and Rebooting*

Cause
-----
- Stuck or incomplete sales transaction.
- Completed credit card transaction stuck on the pump.
- Paper out on receipt printer may also contribute.
- Pumps may hit 2-transaction limit and go to "PUMP BUSY".

Note: Do NOT manually clear transactions over $10 in RadViewer.

Resolution
----------

🚫 DO NOT reboot Fuel registers during failover setup.  
✅ Safe to reboot AFTER site is fully in Failover Mode.  
🚫 Do NOT restart CSS during failover to CC. Let it return to Primary automatically.

B118 Error: Use steps below to verify/clear stuck transactions.  
If not resolved → Reset Fuel Connection → If unresolved, failover and return → Reboot POS if error persists.

Steps
-----

1. **Identify the Pumps** with stuck transactions and note the dollar amounts.

2. **Validate Pump and ICR Status**
   - Use **RadViewer > Fuel Console View**
   - Confirm both Pump and ICR are **Online**.
   - If Offline + 0.00 progress:
     - Run **RCM update**
     - Reboot **Panther**
     - If still Offline → Refer site to **Pump Tech**

3. **Power Cycle the Pump**
   - Instruct site to reboot affected pump(s).
   - If Pump or ICR still Offline → Escalate to Pump Tech.

4. **Check Transaction Details**
   - In RadViewer: `Fuel Console View > Pump X > Sale Information`
   - Match with reported stuck transactions.

5. **Determine System Mode**
   - Ask clerk or check **Global NVP Status**:
     - Green checkmark = Primary
     - Orange B = Backup

   🔹 If in **Backup**:
     - Troubleshoot Backup state first.
     - Then re-check transaction status.

   🔹 If in **Primary**:
     - Proceed (unless transaction is over 24 hrs old — skip to step 9)

6. **Initiate Failover**
   - Stop **Fuel Background Service**
   - Restart **CSS Sessions** on FC controller
   - Verify site is in **Backup Mode** (Orange B)

7. **Check if Transaction Cleared**
   - If yes:
     - Start **Fuel Background Service**
     - Site returns to **Primary Mode**
     - Document and close ticket

8. **If Transaction Still Stuck**
   - Fail back to **Primary**:
     - Start Fuel Background Service + CSS Sessions
   - Verify return to Green Checkmark
   - Re-check transaction

9. **Still Not Cleared?**
   - In RadViewer: Collect transaction details:
     - Dollar Amount
     - Pump Number
     - POS Trans #
     - EPS Trans #
     - Date/Time
     - ACE messages (if any)
   - Run **Fuelzip** on FC controller

10. **Based on Transaction Amount:**
   - **If under $10**:
     - Manually clear in RadViewer
     - Document JIRA: `fctr-1738`
     - Close ticket

   - **If $10 or over**:
     - Ask site to **cone off the pump**
     - DO NOT manually clear
     - Escalate to **APP-Fuel**
       - Priority 3 for isolated pumps

Troubleshooting Notes
---------------------
- If Fuel Services won't show green checkmark after failback:
  - **Reset Fuel Connection** on POS
  - Wait for status to sync


Do NOT clear transactions ≥ $10 without escalation.
