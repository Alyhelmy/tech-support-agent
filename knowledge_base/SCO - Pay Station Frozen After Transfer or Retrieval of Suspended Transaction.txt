Pay Station displays terminal status when attempted.

 

Cause
Pay station’s printer is having an issue communicating with its thermal print head. Could be a lose cable or intermittent cable going to the thermal print head, or the interface card does not have a good connection or printer firmware has problem.

 

Resolution
1. Verify if a transaction originated from paystation can be completed (or voided) with a printed receipt. If not, follow basic printer troubleshooting steps.

2. Reboot the affected paystation.

3. If issue remains, dispatch on thermal printer.
