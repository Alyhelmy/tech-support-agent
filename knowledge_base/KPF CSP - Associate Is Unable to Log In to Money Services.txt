------------------------------------------------------------
Description:
Store associate is unable to log in to CSP Money Services.

------------------------------------------------------------
Cause:
Access permissions and completion of the Annual AML Training course are required before the associate can log in.

------------------------------------------------------------
Resolution:
Record the exact login error and follow the appropriate troubleshooting steps:

Error Message:                           | Action:
----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------
Login spins, never logs in              | Check access permissions
"EUID and Password combination..."      | Check access & confirm AML course completed 48+ hours ago
"...Annual AML Training Course"        | Confirm AML course was taken & get completion date
"Invalid User Name or Password"         | Check for Workforce lockout or expired password
No login on multiple computers          | Check for CSP outage (see Money Services Not Loading KB)

------------------------------------------------------------
Troubleshooting Access to CSP:
To log in successfully, users must meet ALL THREE criteria:
1. Password must be current and not locked
2. CSP access must be granted in IMT
3. Annual AML Course must be completed within the last 365 days

------------------------------------------------------------
1. Verify Current IAM Password:
- Ensure the associate can log in to another system (e.g., IAM).
- If not, suggest updating the password in IAM.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. Verify APT Access in IMT:
- Look up the associate’s job profile in IMT.
- Confirm the CSP role/permission (search for “2270” if needed).
- If permissions are missing, refer associate to management or Division HR.
- If permissions are correct, continue to the next step.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. Verify Annual AML Course Completion:
- Course Name: 2025-Annual Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Fraud Training
- Only this exact course allows access (NOT the CASHIER version).

Steps:
a. Log into MyInfo > Select “Learning”
b. If AML course appears in “Current Learning” > associate must complete it
c. If not listed, go to “All Completed Learning” and look for a Completed status
d. If not completed, go to “Learning Catalog” > search “Money” > Enroll & complete course

Important Notes:
- Only the course with “Annual” in the name counts
- Completion grants access 24–48 hours later (after system sync)
- Anti-Money and Anti-Fraud sections must both be completed
- Issues with course status go to: APP-OracleHCMLearning

------------------------------------------------------------
Escalation:
If the associate:
- Has correct APT access
- Completed the correct Annual AML course
- Has current password and is not locked out
But still cannot log in, escalate the issue to APP-KPF. 
Include a screenshot of completed course with timestamp, if available.

------------------------------------------------------------
MyInfo Course Issues (Missing or Stuck):
- If the correct Annual AML course is missing or stuck,
  escalate to: APP-OracleHCMLearning team via ServiceNow.
