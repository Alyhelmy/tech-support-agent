Bill Jamming Issues:
Verify that if bills being loaded into dispenser, if they are brand new bills, they will need to be fanned so they are not so sticky in dispensing.

 

Verify Issue Is Not:
  - Due to Low Amount of Money in Dispenser - Needs to be resolved by Bookkeeper

  - Due to Physical Jamming/Issues - Needs to be resolved by store and/or dispatched.

  - Ask store if money has been loaded recently, if so, it may need to be ruffled and/or cash tracking needs to be updated to account for new bills (if showing that it ran out of denomination)

  - Have store check Reject Bin for large quantities of bills. This will cause jamming and issues with dispensing.

NOTE: If F53 Bill Dispenser gives out an error code, see attached doc and Error Code Spreadsheet: F53 Error Codes PDF. (Not all error codes may be present in spreadsheet.)

 

For Bill Dispenser Cassette Issues
 

Note: By swapping the location/order of the F53 Bill Cassettes you can test to see if it's a bill dispenser issue or an actual Cassette issue.

 

If a bill dispenser cassette is damaged or worn, dispatch via CAP in linked document: Dispatching IBM for Fujitsu Bill Dispense Cassette Replacement (CAP)

 

If bills are jamming inside of the cassettes or multiple bills are dispensing, see:
