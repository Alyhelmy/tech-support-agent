Description
SCO Lane will not load past, "U005 LDB".

 

Cause
UPS USB is connected to TCU.

 

Resolution
1. Verify model of lane; this document only applies to Fujitsu Genesis Casing Models.

2. Verify is tech is onsite and/or calling.

3. If tech is not onsite, dispatch tech to, "Verify UPS USB Cable is not plugged into Toshiba TCU".

4. If tech is onsite, have them verify USB Cable from UPS is not plugged into lane. This configuration only works for Toshiba System 6 Lanes, not Fujitsu Genesis lanes.
