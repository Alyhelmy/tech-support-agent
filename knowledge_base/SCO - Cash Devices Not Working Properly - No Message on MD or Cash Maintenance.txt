Resolution:

1. Take an extract through the SA Menu, Current + Previous.  
   - Collect Date, Time, & Lane # for each extract.

2. Document the color of the indicator light of the affected device during troubleshooting and whether it is flashing or solid. (Red or Green).

3. For bill acceptors:  
   - Is the bill inserted then returned/rejected or cannot be inserted at all?  
   - If bill is being returned, have store attempt another "good" bill.

4. Attempt closing/opening lane using the black/green (Sys6) TCU power button and retesting first via Cash Diagnostics.  
   See Toshiba SCO - How to Use Cash Diagnostics to Test Acceptors / Dispensers / Recyclers.

5. 9-load affected lane.

6. Troubleshoot device in question.

7. If the device is not working properly after troubleshooting, collect extracts from the store and then get with Frontend Tier 2 to escalate ticket to APP-POS P3.  
   If the device is working, then Tier 2 can escalate as a P4.
