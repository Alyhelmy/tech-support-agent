Synopsis  
--------
CSP Money Transfer allows customers to send money without third-party hardware (e.g., no WU terminals). Transactions are performed entirely within the Customer Service Platform (CSP).  

> Person-to-Person = Money Transfer  
> Person-to-Business = Bill Pay  

Vendors: Ria & Western Union  
Refunds must be done in the platform they were initiated in.

Refer all "how to" questions to store management or Division Front End Coordinator.  
Customer info is only accessible via their phone number.

Common Issues & Special Cases
-----------------------------

❌ Unable to Transfer to Iran  
- Due to sanctions, Iran is **not selectable** as a destination. This is by design.

❌ Reporting Issues  
- APP-KPF does not support financial reconciliation or report fixes. Refer to bookkeeper or divisional KPF coordinator.

--------------------------------------------------
Paging Guidelines
-----------------
✅ OK to Page APP-KPF if:
- CSP Money Transfer is **DOWN/UNUSABLE**
- Many users cannot sign in for **unknown reasons**
- Repeated errors across **multiple stores**

❌ Do NOT Page if:
