Description
-----------
Toshiba Self-Checkout (SCO) lanes display:
- "Remove all items from the bagging area"  
- "Are you using your own bags"  
These messages persist and **cannot be cleared**.

Cause
-----
The issue is typically caused by:
- Hardware faults with the **bagging scale**
- Calibration issues

Resolution
----------

1. **Enter SA Mode**:
   - Select the option to **Zero Bagging Area**.

2. If not resolved:
   - **Remove all bags and/or bag racks** from the scale.

3. Ensure the **"Zero Bagging Area"** button is still visible on the screen.

4. Replace all bags and **zero the scale again**.

   ⚠️ Note:  
   You may need to act **quickly** when clearing errors — it can be a **looping error**.  
   Clear one error, scan barcode, and quickly zero the scale before the next prompt appears.

5. If issue persists:
   - **Power cycle the TCU** and UPS.
     - Keep powered off for **2+ minutes**.
     - ⚠️ For System 6 or 7, **UPS power cycle is not required**.

6. If issue is **still not resolved**:
   - **Dispatch per NIMS** Parts List and procedures.
