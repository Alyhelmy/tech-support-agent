### Coin Dispenser Not Dispensing

1. **Check Cash Maintenance for Errors:**
   - Navigate to **Cash Maintenance > Cash Maintenance > Touch "Problem" > Touch the error > OK > Go Back**.
   - Refer to: *K14262 Toshiba SCO - Cash Maintenance Errors*

2. **Close and Reopen the Lane.**

3. **Verify Cash Tracking Values:**
   - Ensure amounts > 0 and match physical coin inventory.
   - Bookkeeper access may be required to view Cash Tracking under SA Menu.

4. **Inspect Coin Canister:**
   - Look for jams, damage, or loose coins.
   - See section **"How to Clear Jammed Coin"** below if jam found.

5. **Check Coin Levels:**
   - A single empty row can cause an "offline" error.

6. **Reseat or Swap Coin Canister:**
   - Listen for buzzing sound upon reseating.
   - If not, power cycle using the switch on the back and recheck cable.

⚠️ **Loose coins in the chute** may falsely report successful dispense but actually block exit path.

7. **Avoid Overfilling:**
   - Excess weight may trigger errors.

8. **Power Cycle Lane:**
   - Refer to: *Toshiba SCO - Procedural - How to Perform Lane Power On/Off, Shut Down, 9-Load, or 8-Load*

9. **Still Not Working?**
   - Dispatch per **KSC Hardware Dispatching For All Pillars**.
