1. Check if the issue occurs only with the SA barcode or if the same error
    happens when attempting to sign in both ways.

2. If the barcode does not work, print a new barcode and try again.

3. If the password does not work, verify that the associate is using correct password.

4. 8-load (terminal dump) the lane and process the dump.

5. If issue remains, call Frontend Tier 2 queue to have the controller the lanes are
    assigned to coldbooted.

6. Frontend Tier 2: After the controller is rebooted, have user try to sign in, if unable to then
    send a 9-load to the affected lane(s).

7. If issue remains, cold boot the MC, then have the associate attempt to sign on.

8.  If unable to resolve, Frontend Tier 2 escalate to APP-POS, P3, with extract or Terminal
     Dump.

    Escalate as P2 if all lanes.
