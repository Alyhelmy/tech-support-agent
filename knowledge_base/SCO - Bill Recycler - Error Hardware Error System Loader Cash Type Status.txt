Description
-----------
This error typically appears **after full balancing** or after **loading bills via the loader cassette**.

⚠️ Note:  
Outside of the **monthly Full Balance**, bills should be loaded using the **bill acceptor**, NOT the loader cassette.

If the error is:  
**"Cash Type Status_CTS Wrong Setting"**,  
refer to: *Toshiba SCO - Bill Recycler/Handler - Error "Cash Type Status_CTS Wrong Setting"*

Resolution
----------

Standard Full Balance Recovery Steps
------------------------------------
1. Open the **casing door**.

2. Insert the **key** into the top lock and turn to the **right**.

3. Push the **yellow knob/lever** slightly back to release the loader cassette.

4. Remove the **loader cassette**.

5. **Open the loader box** (apply pressure on top and open with the key).

   ⚠️ **Only $1 bills** should be present.
   - If $5, $10, or $20 bills are inside, **remove them**.
   - These should be fed via the **acceptor** or returned to the cash office.

   ➤ Full Balancing: All denominations can be loaded (stacked $1s on bottom, $20s on top, face up).

6. **Ensure bottom panel is pressed down** until it clicks — critical for proper loader engagement.

7. Reload **$1 bills** if applicable.

8. Feed $5, $10, $20 bills manually through the acceptor or return to the cash office.

9. **Close and lock** the loader. Reseat it back into the Recycler.  
   ✅ Light = Green  
   ❌ Red light = repeat steps to re-engage properly.

10. **Pull yellow knob** toward you to lock the unit.

11. **Turn key left** to lock and remove it.

12. **Error should now clear** from the screen.

13. If issue persists:
    - **Reboot the lane**.
    - If still unresolved, **dispatch Toshiba**.

Improper Use (Loader Used to Add $5/$10/$20 Outside Full Balance)
------------------------------------------------------------------
If bills besides $1s were added via loader cassette:

1. **Open loader**, remove all bills, and **rearm** the loader.

2. Replace **only $1s** in loader and lock it.

3. Reseat loader into lane.

4. Navigate to:
   - Cash Maintenance > select problem device (e.g., Bill Handler)

5. On the right, select **"Add Cash"**

6. You’ll be taken to **Cash Tracking**:
   - Go to **Bill Handler** tab.

7. On the right, select **“Load Bills Through Acceptor”**.

8. Feed $5, $10, $20 into the **bill acceptor**.

Best Practices Reminder
-----------------------
- During full balance: Use **loader** for all denominations (stacked correctly).
- All other times: Use **bill acceptor**.
- Loader box must be **clicked closed and seated** properly to function.
- If loader light stays **red**, reset and reseat again.

Dispatch Conditions
-------------------
Dispatch Toshiba if:
- Error persists after reboot
- Loader light remains red
- Solenoid/engagement mechanism fails
