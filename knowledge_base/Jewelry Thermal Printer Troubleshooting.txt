Resolution
----------

Printer or Cash Drawer Not Working - Basic Troubleshooting:
-----------------------------------------------------------
No Printer Hardware Found:
1. Verify the Printer has power.
   - No lights = No Power (See Printer Power Troubleshooting Section Below)

2. Does the Printer have a Solid Green Light or Flashing?
   - Flashing = Printer has an error (See Flashing Green Light Section Below)
   - Solid Green = Printer is in Correct Operating Mode.

3. Manually power off the register, wait 30 seconds, then power it back on.
   If problem remains continue to step 4.

4. Open Device Manager in GSI to verify the register detects the Receipt Printer.

Correct Ports:
--------------
Note: If it shows any other port than COM9, correct the port following these steps:
  - Right click USB Serial Port A776 and select PROPERTIES
  - Choose the PORT SETTINGS Tab.
  - Click the ADVANCED button.
  - From the COM Port Number drop down menu, select COM9
  - Click OK on both boxes and close Device Manager.
  - Click the Reboot button in GSI.

If only Intel(R) Active Management Technology - SOL (COM6) is showing,
the store will need to reseat the USB patch cable on the back of the register.

5. Once the Receipt Printer USB Serial Port A776 is showing in Device Manager,
verify it shows COM9.

6. Restart Gemstore from the Launcher Menu.

Printer Power Troubleshooting:
------------------------------
If the printer has no power:
1. Trace cable connections to ensure they are securely connected to printer, power brick, and power outlet.

2. If connections are secure, try reseating cables or try a different power outlet.
   After reseating cables, perform a shutdown restart on the register.

3. If unresolved, swap printers with another register to isolate issue.

4. If swapping printers did not fix issue, try a different port on register and reboot.
   - If this resolves the issue, dispatch the register.
   - If unresolved, dispatch printer for replacement.

Power Cable:

Green Flashing Light:
---------------------
- Is the printer out of paper?
- Is the paper loaded correctly?
- Is the paper door closed securely?
- Is there an extra black spindle left from last paper replacement?
- Verify paper is standard thermal paper and inserted correctly (not backwards).

Clean out the printer:
1. Remove paper, turn printer over, pat lightly to remove debris.
2. Check receipt roller by spinning it, ensure no stuck paper pieces.
3. Blow out printer with canned air if possible.
4. Re-install paper, close lid, check light status.
5. Restart register if no change.

Cables:
-------
Three cables:
 1. Power supply connector
 2. USB connector
 3. Cash drawer connector

To access cables, put printer on front end and unlatch hinged door blocking cables.

Verify cash drawer cable is plugged correctly: ends labeled EPSON (to printer) and C/D (to cash drawer).

Steps:
1. Remove power cable from printer.
2. While unplugged, reseat USB and cash drawer cables.
3. Plug power cable back in.
4. Restart register.

Check Reader Troubleshooting:
-----------------------------
Not allowing check insertion:
- See Jewelry: How To Process Checks for check procedural instructions.

1. Verify caller follows procedure correctly and printer is ready to accept check.
   - Premature removal or skipping prompts can cause print head to stick.

2. Inspect check insertion area for debris or jams.

3. Have caller insert check; sometimes Gemstore appears frozen but is waiting for check.

4. Confirm bottom green indicator light turns green when check inserted.
   - If green but check not pulled, Gemstore is frozen; restart required.

5. If check can't fully insert due to blockage, reset print head:
   - Open check reader door (folds toward caller).
   - Gently push printer cartridge in track to the right.
   - Close door until clicks heard.
   - Retry inserting check; green light should turn on and check pull through.

6. If print head won't return to neutral position, dispatch replacement.

Check Reader Cleaning:
----------------------
Clean track with canned air and/or thick paper (e.g., envelope).

Not Franking Back of Checks:
----------------------------
1. Verify register has a printer ribbon installed correctly and plastic shipping cover removed.
2. Comparing with another printerâ€™s ribbon may help verify installation.

New Ribbons:
------------
Can be ordered from FEED - Operations - Supply Order Form - Item# TPG-A152-0043.

Jamming While Reading Checks:
-----------------------------
Check check read track for debris.

Receipt Printer Troubleshooting:
--------------------------------
Note: First receipt printer after any shutdown/restart has a delay before printing.

Register Freezes While Printing Receipt:
1. Verify printer light not blinking and paper not low.
2. If okay, close and reopen Gemstore.
3. If issue persists, reset printer cables and perform Shutdown/Restart.

Verify transaction completed via TRANSACTIONS SEARCH.

IMPORTANT:
- If credit/debit was used and transaction not in TRANSACTION SEARCH, check Payment Systems for card charge (See K9085).
- If credit tender used and approval code shows in Payment Systems:
  See: Jewelry: How to Take a Register Offline for Manual Authorization.
- If transaction completed, re-print receipt.
- If not showing in Gemstore or Payment Systems, re-ring transaction with appropriate tender.
