**Description:**  
Touchscreen buttons display a **Red X** when attempting to perform transactions (e.g., prepay, refund, set pump).  
The associate is unable to complete fuel-related tasks.

ðŸ“Œ **Note:** This is NOT related to the Red X on Fuel or Tank Monitor icons at the bottom of the screen.  
This issue appears when interacting directly with fuel pump action buttons.

**Resolution:**

1. **Reset Fuel Connection:**
   - From the POS terminal, use the **Name Menu** â†’ **Reset Fuel Connection**.
   - Reference: *FUEL Touchscreen Entry â€“ POS Name Menu*

2. **Check Peripherals:**
   - Ensure all connected peripherals (e.g., Handscanner, printer) have power and are error-free.

3. **Send 9-Load:**
   - From the ACE Controller, send a **9 load** to the affected terminal.
   - Fuel registers typically start at **terminal 100**.

4. **Copy Terminal Options:**
   - If the issue persists, contact **Frontend Tier 2**.
   - Have them **copy terminal options** from a functioning fuel lane to the one experiencing issues.
   - After update, have the associate sign out and back in.

5. **Escalate to APP-Fuel:**
   - If none of the above resolves the issue, escalate to **APP-Fuel** as **Priority 2 (P2)**.
