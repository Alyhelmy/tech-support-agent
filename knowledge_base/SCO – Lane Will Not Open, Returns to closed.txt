Description:  
When the associate attempts to open the lane from the “Closed” screen by scanning the SA barcode, the lane doesn’t open and instead returns to the “Closed” screen.  
An audio message “This lane is closed” may play from the lane.  

Cause:  
Software  
- Can occur after a lane has been STC'd (reimaged)  
- NOTE: If issue occurs following an SSD (hard drive) replacement, go directly to Step 5 below.  

Resolution:  
Note: With the new changes disabling Security Mode, verify if the store is attempting to open the lane with the barcode **before** escalating to Frontend Tier 2.  

1. Check if the issue occurs only with the SA barcode or also when signing in manually with password.  
2. If barcode does not work, print a new barcode and try again.  
3. If password does not work, verify associate is using the correct password.  
4. Perform an 8-load (terminal dump) and process it.  
5. If issue remains, call Frontend Tier 2 to cold boot the controller the lanes are assigned to.  
6. After controller reboot, have user try to sign in. If unable to, send a 9-load to affected lane(s).  
7. If issue persists, cold boot the MC and have the associate try signing in again.  
8. If issue is still unresolved:  
   - Frontend Tier 2 should escalate to APP-POS, P3 with extract or terminal dump.  
   - Escalate as **P2** if all lanes are affected.  

Required Information:  
1. Extract or dump is needed for all cases.  
2. Ask if lane has recently been STC'd (within the last week). Check location ticket history and include this in the notes.
