Jewelry: Unable to Login to Gemstore
KB0011617 - Latest Version
===============================================================================

Description
-----------
User is unable to log in to Gemstore or Vision Store Management (VSM).

To login to GemStore, the login screen must show "Operator ID".
If "Operator ID" is missing, the register may be applying background updates. This process can take up to 10 minutes.

===============================================================================
Single User Issue
-----------------
If only one associate is affected:

1. Verify their Workforce account is NOT locked.
2. Check if their password is expired.
3. Confirm their password is exactly 8 characters long.
4. Ask when they last successfully logged into Gemstore.

If the user has *never* logged in before:
- Have them attempt to sign into **Vision Store** first.
  - Gemstore profiles are created after the **first successful** Vision Store login.

If they cannot log in to Vision Store:

A. If the error states the profile is not set up:
   - User may not exist in LDAP or is using the wrong password.
     - Have them reset their password.
     - If issue persists, escalate to App-Merch-ORE2.0-Jewelry.

B. Invalid Password or Missing Home Location:
   - Log in to Vision Store Maintenance > Operations > System User Details > User Maintenance.
   - Search using the EUID.
   - If no results or only lowercase EUID appears, escalate to App-Merch-ORE2.0-Jewelry.

C. Invalid User Role:
   - Check APT profile; it must list the user as a Jewelry Associate.

===============================================================================
Checking User’s Profile
-----------------------
1. Open IMT (Identity Management Tool).
2. Go to Tools > Review Access > Profile and Accounts.
3. Enter EUID and click Search.
4. Confirm:
   - Associate is listed as a Jewelry Associate.
   - "Jewelry" appears under Current Access.

===============================================================================
New Jewelry Associate
---------------------
- Confirm Jewelry Associate role and Jewelry account under Current Access.
- Try sending new cache to the register.

If account shows:
   - Division: 000
   - Location: 00000
   - No Job Description

=> Profile is incomplete. Wait 48 hours before escalating to DIV-FM-LocalSecurityAdmin.

===============================================================================
Transferred Jewelry Associate
-----------------------------
- Confirm APT profile shows Jewelry Associate and Jewelry account.
- If associate is still listed as a Main Store employee, their transfer is incomplete.
- Refer the manager to HR to verify transfer status.

===============================================================================
Current Jewelry Associate
-------------------------
Common causes for access loss:
- Jewelry account removed by mistake.
- Role change (e.g., promotion to Manager or Assistant Manager).

Escalation:
- During business hours: P3 ticket to DIV-FM-LocalSecurityAdmin.
- After hours: P2 ticket to INF-UnifiedIdentityAccessManagement.

===============================================================================
Multiple Users Affected
-----------------------
1. Is the issue on one or both registers?
2. Does Gemstore show “Operator ID” or “Store Closed”?
   - If “Store Closed”: Start of Day must be completed in Vision Store.

3. Does the Enter ID box respond to input?
   - If not, troubleshoot the keyboard.

4. Check Server and Cache lights on Gemstore:
   - Left Light (Server): Red = Server Offline. Restart register.
   - Right Light (Cache): Red = Cache issue. See: "Jewelry: Cachegen, Sending, Verifying or Corrupt Cache (DB2)"

If troubleshooting fails:

- One Register: P3 ticket to App-Merch-ORE2.0-Jewelry.
- Both Registers: P2 ticket to App-Merch-ORE2.0-Jewelry.
