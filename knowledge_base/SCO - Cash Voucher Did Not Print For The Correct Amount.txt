Cause:
Software

Resolution:

Scenario:  
A customer completes a transaction; they are due change. A voucher prints instead but for an amount different from what is being displayed on the lane.  
Example: Change due back is $13.06, voucher prints for $11.

Required Information:  
1. Take an extract through SA Menu SCO - How To Take An Extract or a Terminal Dump if unable to take an extract.  
   See SCO - MISC - How to Perform and Prepare a Terminal or TCU Dump.

2. What was the last thing that happened prior to the issue occurring? Were there any other errors?

3. Have SA reprint a receipt to check if it matches the voucher.

4. Do not reprint a voucher. The SA should save the voucher for accounting purposes and give the customer the correct change due back.

Steps to Resolve:

1. Check Cash Maintenance and document any hardware errors found.

2. Run checuser.bat, option 1. See CHECUSER 2.0.

3. Activate terminal configuration:  
   - Log into the MC, option 4. Installation and Update Aids.  
   - Select 1. Change Configuration Data  
   - Select 4. Activate Configuration Data  
   - Select 1. Terminal Configuration. Press F10 to view messages, then F3 to escape.

4. Power cycle the affected lanes via the Powervar or UPS, left off for 2+ minutes.  
   If this is a system 6 or 7, you do not need to power cycle the UPS.

5. If issue is resolved, process and rename dump and get with Frontend Tier 2 to escalate to APP-POS, P4.

6. If issue remains, escalate ticket with dump/extract as a P4 for one lane, P3 for multiple lanes.
