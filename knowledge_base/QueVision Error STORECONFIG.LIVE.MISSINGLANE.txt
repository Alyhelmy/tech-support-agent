**Description:**  
Explains the cause and resolution of the **"MISSINGLANE"** Store Configuration error in QueVision.  
üîß This error is auto-reported to MOM via SNMP and generates an **Infra ticket**.

üìå Note: Use this only for **auto-generated MOM tickets**.  
For store-reported missing lanes, use **K7087**.  
For detector issues, check the appropriate **KSC queue**.

---

**Cause:**  
A lane listed in the store config is not detected or recognized on the Controller Area Network (CAN).  
- Possible sensor misconfiguration or malfunction  
- The sensor may be turned off or unresponsive  
- Error typically caught at SDI boot or at failure

---

**Resolution:**

1. Open a browser and access the SDI:  
   `http://sdi.xx###` (replace with division + store number)  
   Or use the **SDI IP address** listed in TUNA

2. **Check SDI time is advancing** (refresh if needed)  
   - ‚úÖ If advancing, go to Step 4  
   - ‚ùå If NOT advancing:
     - Instruct store to **physically reboot SDI** (remove power for 30 sec)  
     - Log result in ticket  
     - Wait 5‚Äì10 min post reboot and recheck  
     - If still frozen ‚Üí escalate to **APP-ISA P3**  
     - If recovered ‚Üí close ticket

3. Skip if reboot not needed

4. Click **Support Center tab** ‚Üí log into Basic Support ‚Üí go to **Help Center**

5. Record any **Help Center info** into ticket  
   - If error-free ‚Üí **link this doc and close**  
   - If errors present ‚Üí proceed

6. **Attempt a hard reboot of the SDI**, if not already done  
   - If store can do this, wait 10 minutes after power up  
   - Monitor for a full minute‚Äîif errors toggle or clear, **close ticket**  
   - If still erroring, continue

7. Open **Unit Status page** from Support Center  
   - Observe if multiple errors are present  
   - Wait 1 minute to check for toggling  
   - If **all lanes/doors show constant errors**, escalate to **APP-ISA P3**

8. Have the store **physically inspect the front/master detector sensor** on the affected lane:  
   - ‚úÖ **Normal behavior**: Red and green LEDs pulse every ~5 seconds  
   - üö´ **Error state**:
     - Case A: Red LED = Solid  
     - Case B: Both LEDs OFF; rear node sensor = Red solid, Green blinks x3

9. **Document LED behavior** for both front and rear sensors and escalate to **APP-ISA P3**
