Description:  
One or multiple pumps are over or under dispensing.  

Resolution:  

Single Pump is Over or Under Dispensing:  
1. If the pump nozzle is releasing early or not releasing when the customerâ€™s tank is full, see "KSC Hardware Dispatching For All Pillars" for pump hardware dispatch.  
2. If the issue is not with the nozzle, power cycle the dispenser at the breaker. If the issue continues, dispatch pump hardware via "KSC Hardware Dispatching For All Pillars".  

Multiple Pumps Are Over or Under Dispensing:  
1. For issues involving:  
   - Credit Authorization Limits  
   - 35 Gallon Loyalty Limit  
   - Additech pumps stopping short  
   Note: Some sites have an unattended, overnight limit of 25 gallons. Contact the division lead if the unattended limit is incorrect.  

2. For other issues, approve a **Full Update** in RCM and reboot the Fuel Controller.  
   (See: Approving Full Update In RCM)  

NOTE:  
If the Division Lead has questions about the issue of a pump going over, provide them with the **2 Word docs attached** (containing APP-Fuel recommendations). APP-Fuel has requested that Division Fuel Leads contact them if assistance is needed.  

Close the ticket.
