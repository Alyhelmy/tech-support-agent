SCO - Honeywell Wireless Handscanner Basic Troubleshooting  
KB0011277
===============================================================================

Description
-----------
This article covers the use and troubleshooting of the Honeywell Xenon Wireless Handscanner solution for Self-Checkout (SCO) Lanes and PayStations.

- Replaces old SCO mobile devices (no longer supported by IBM)
- Each terminal includes a base for syncing the scanner
- Syncing is done via a virtual barcode displayed in SA (Store Associate) mode

NOTE: If a store is still using SCO Mobile Attendants, refer them to their Division for support.

===============================================================================
Causes
-------
- Scanner not charging
- Sync issues between scanner and base/lane
- Missing virtual barcode
- Out-of-box failure (OOBF)
- Communication/power issues with base

===============================================================================
Resolution
-----------

‚ñ∂ General Facts
- Scanner connects via Bluetooth to the lane through a base
- Scanner can be synced by placing it in the base or scanning the lane-specific barcode
- Virtual barcode is visible only in SA mode (via hidden top-right button)

‚ñ∂ Notes:
- Missing/lost/stolen scanners can now be dispatched to IBM as of 09/04/2024
- ‚ÄúItem not found‚Äù on new scanners may indicate an OOBF ‚Üí tech must reprogram
  (work with Top Gun before escalating to APP-POS via Frontend Tier 2)

Basic Troubleshooting Steps
----------------------------

üü¢ Scanner not Charging or Battery Drains Quickly:

1. Check **LED lights** on both **scanner** and **base** for status
2. Ensure scanner is securely seated in the base
3. Clean battery/contact points (both scanner and base)
4. Replug base power cable
5. Reboot the SCO lane
6. If base fails to power on ‚Üí Dispatch per IBM/Toshiba Dispatching Procedures

üõ† LED Light Reference:

- **Base:**
  - Green (slow flash): Charging
  - Green (solid): Fully charged
  - Green (fast flash): Charging error
  - Red (off): Power failure
  - Green (off): Battery not detected

- **Scanner:**
  - Red flashing: Low battery
  - "Razz" tone: Communication error

===============================================================================
üü† Scanner Not Communicating with a Lane / Barcode Not Scanning:

1. Ensure screen is clean
2. Place scanner into the specific lane base to sync
3. Try scanning barcode again after resync
4. Reconfigure DataMatrix barcode (scan and wait for 3 tones)
5. If unresolved ‚Üí send a 9-load to the lane
6. If still unresolved ‚Üí document lane model and dispatch per procedures
7. If tech calls needing barcode ‚Üí email the linked DataMatrix barcode

===============================================================================
üî¥ Virtual Barcode is Missing:

1. Ask if barcode missing on **all lanes** or only **some lanes**
2. Determine if it ever worked before
3. Confirm base is present and powered inside each lane

- If base is missing or unpowered:
  ‚Üí Reboot one lane to check if barcode returns
  ‚Üí If still missing, dispatch tech to verify and troubleshoot base connection

- If base is powered:
  ‚Üí Place scanner into the lane‚Äôs base and wait for sync beep

- If barcode missing on **some** lanes:
  ‚Üí Dispatch tech to check connections, reseat cables

- Escalate to APP-POS **only if**:
  - Tech has verified base presence & functionality
  - Barcode missing on **all lanes**
