**Step 1: Identify Switch Model**

**Step 2: Verify Switch Connectivity**
1. Open **PSY Device Connect**
2. Input store info > Select Lookup > Scroll to Switches

   - Press `1` > Enter > Management > Enter > F9
   - Locate and ping switch with `Ctrl + D`
   - Use `Ctrl + C` to stop ping
6. If switch is pinging:
   - Power cycle UPS + TCU for 2 mins (skip UPS for System 6 or 7)
7. If switch does NOT ping:
   - Verify switch has power/activity lights
   - Try a different outlet if needed

**Step 3: Verify Lane Pinging**
1. Login to **TUNA**
2. Press `1` > Enter > POS and Fuel Segment > Enter > F9
3. Identify lane from list (e.g., SCS MT = 500+)
4. Ping target lane with `Ctrl + D`
5. If ping fails:
   - Check switch power & cable connections
   - Try alternate outlet to test power
6. Stop pinging with `Ctrl + C`
7. Locate MAC address in TUNA
8. Check if MAC is in **Radius Exception List**:
   - If not, add it > Press `Q` to quit and save
   - Power cycle TCU again
9. If lane still doesnâ€™t load:
   - Refer to: *Error "W064 Contacting Controller" on a POS Register*
