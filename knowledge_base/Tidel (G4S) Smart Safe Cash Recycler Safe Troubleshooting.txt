   - *DO NOT* use external ping tools (e.g., PSY)

3. If no ping response:  
   - Verify MAC with Deposita tech  
   - Ensure correct NIC MAC is in TUNA (only the network NIC)

4. If MAC differs:  
   - Note old/new MAC in the ticket  
   - Update TUNA  
   - Wait a few minutes for connection

   - Go to **Management Segment**  
   - Highlight the switch â†’ press **F5**

10. **Verify VLAN is 2900**
