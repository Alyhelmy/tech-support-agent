Equipment Location
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Switches are typically located in:
- **Stock room**  
- **Nearest IDF cabinet**

→ Register switches are uplinked to the IDF cabinet on the main store network.  
→ Some stores may uplink both register switches to a main switch in a **FMJ IDF cabinet**.

Support responsibilities:
- **KSC-Store Support:** Supports IDF cabinet switches.
- **KSC-Frontend:** Provides basic troubleshooting for register switches.
- **NOC:** For WAN/router/CSU-DSU issues.

Jewelry Register Switches
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Typically **1 switch per register**
- Models: **HP 2530** or **Aruba 6000**
- In small stores, both registers may share a single switch.
- Some HP 2530 models in FMJ stores may have external power adapters (rare).

**Puck Device:**
- Some stores have a puck that connects long-run cables to patch cables.
- Only troubleshooting step: **reseat the cable**
- Normally attached to fixture, but may come loose.

Troubleshooting Steps
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**1. Check Power & Cabling:**
- Inspect all three connections on the back of the switch.
- Ensure outlet or power strip is working.
- If the switch is not powering on, it may need a new power supply or adapter.

**2. Power-Cycle the Switch:**
- If the switch has power but is unreachable, try rebooting it.

**3. Bypass the Switch (Isolate the issue):**
- Connect the register’s Ethernet cable directly into the wall port.

**4. For a Single Register Down:**
