**Description:**  
This document should be used to troubleshoot the Honeywell **wired** handscanner on the SCO Pay Station.  
(For wireless handscanner issues, refer to: SCO - Paystation - Honeywell Wireless Handscanner Basic Troubleshooting)

---

**Known Issue:**
- A Honeywell 1900 or 1950 handscanner connected to a Dell 7080+ may not work.
- Cause: New chipsets do not provide sufficient USB power for 15’ cables.
- **Fix**: Replace with a 10’ cable. Only 3-meter cables work consistently.
- Applies especially during workstation refreshes (e.g., Pharmacy).
- Techs should contact their internal team for cable orders.

**General Notes:**
- As of 09/04/2024, missing/stolen POS handscanners can be dispatched to IBM.
- Located only at Pay Stations.
- If newly replaced handscanner gives "item not found" → may require reprogramming.
  - Fujitsu techs: Contact NTS
  - Toshiba techs: Contact Top Gun
