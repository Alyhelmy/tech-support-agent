Description:  
Register is not on the network so KSC is unable to perform a Terminal Dump.  
You will not see the register in Terminal Status.  
This could happen on a SCO lane or FE Lane.  

Example Error Message:  
“Error Loading TCx ™ Sky 1.2.01-02”  
- Preload failed with RC 23, Unable to continue, rebooting in 1 minute...  
- Terminal Boot Model 4900785 - Failed to get an IP address via DHCP. Unable to continue, rebooting in 1 minute...  

Cause:  
This is a new error introduced with the release of TCxSky.  
APP-POS is currently researching the root cause.  

Resolution:  
Note the exact error listed under the "Error Loading TCx(TM) Sky 1.2.01-2" message as it may vary.  

1. Verify the network switch the register is connected to is pinging.  
2. Verify all cables plugged into the network switch are in the correct ports.  
3. Restart the network switch (if store cannot do this, attempt restart via TUNA).  
4. In Command Mode, run `ADXRTCCL` to rebuild terminal preload files and then reboot the register.  
5. If the issue persists, escalate to Store Support to inspect the network.  
6. If unresolved after network inspection, dispatch a technician to inspect the hardware.
