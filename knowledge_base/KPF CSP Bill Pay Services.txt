Description
-----------
Bill Pay is used when a customer pays a biller directly through the CSP money system. If a store receives an error when processing a payment, the necessary information must be collected before troubleshooting or escalating.

Note: All “how-to” questions should be directed to store management or the Division Front End Coordinator.

Solution
--------
- Person to Business = Bill Pay  
- Person to Person = Money Transfer

Before You Begin
----------------
- If the error is from a Money Transfer, see: *KPF CSP Money Transfer*  
- If the error is from Bill Pay, continue with this document.  
- Stores are NOT participating in Amazon Product Payment at this time.
