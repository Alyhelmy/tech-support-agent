Description:
Register will not boot past "W064 Contacting Controller".

Cause:
Hardware, Network, MAC Address, or TUNA problem.

Resolution:
Note: This issue is currently being investigated to determine the source cause of lanes getting stuck on W064.
Before doing any troubleshooting, answer the following questions:
- Was the lane rebooted from the UPS?
- What type of casing is the SCO Lane?

Follow the steps below. If assistance is needed, call Frontend Tier 2 prior to reaching out to Store Support.

ALL TERMINALS STUCK ON "W064 CONTACTING CONTROLLER":
1. Call Frontend Tier 2 to warm IPL all other controllers.
2. The terminals should reconnect. If not, send a 9-load to reboot the terminal.

ONE OR TWO TERMINALS STUCK ON "W064 CONTACTING CONTROLLER":
1. Locate the switch and lane in TUNA and check if they are pinging.
   - Use Netmapper to find the switch and lane MAC address.
   - Reference: "How To Use Netmapper"
   - Troubleshoot for network issues using:
     -> SCO - Hardware - Basic Network / Switch Hardware Troubleshooting

2. Enter the lane’s MAC addresses into the Whitelist:
   - Connect to TUNA > 2 [Enter] (Network Administration) > 5 [Enter] (Network) > 2 [Enter] (Add/Delete MAC Address)
   - Enter the MAC Address and press [Enter], then Q to quit and update the file.
   - Reboot the lane.

3. If the switch is pinging and issue remains after steps 1 and 2:
   - Disable and re-enable the uplink port on the 5412 switch (refer to attachment: w064.docx).
   - If unfamiliar with the procedure, call Frontend Tier 2 for assistance.

4. Frontend Tier 2 should follow instructions in the w064.docx.

5. If issue continues:
   - Run CHECUSER (switch for terminal must be online before running).
   - CHECUSER 2.0

6. Power cycle the lane’s TCU only if the issue remains.

7. If the issue continues, reach out to Store Support to investigate the network further.

8. If Store Support finds no issue and the lane is still not pinging, dispatch a tech to check hardware.
   - Reference: KSC Hardware Dispatching For All Pillars

9. If the switch is not pinging:
   - Power off the lane and UPS (the switch may be attached to the UPS).
   - If the switch is still not pinging after being powered on for 5 minutes, dispatch per KSC Hardware Dispatching For All Pillars.
