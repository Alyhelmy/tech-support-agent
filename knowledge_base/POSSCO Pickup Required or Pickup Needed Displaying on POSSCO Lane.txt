This is for KSC informational use only and should not necessarily be shared with stores as its procedural in nature.

A pickup is when the manager takes money from the lane and drops it into the safe so that the register does not exceed a certain amount of money for security/safety reasons.

Stores should be able to handle procedural issues on their own and should be referred to store, district, or division management/front end coordinator for assistance.

 

Pickup Needed

The controller believes the lane in question has enough money to trigger a "pickup needed" reminder, thus reminding the store to perform a pickup on the lane.

This should still allow the lane to function, just will keep popping up reminding them they have reached the threshold and should perform a cash drop or pickup soon.

A cash drop needs to be done and processed in VeriBalance/controller in order for the register alerts to clear. Once processed correctly, the alert should clear almost instantly.

 

Pickup Required

The register has exceeded the maximum amount of cash allowed as per the division/loss prevention rules.

The register locks up and will not allow further orders to be completed/processed on the lane until the store performs a pickup in VeriBalance/controller.

A cash drop needs to be done and processed in VeriBalance/controller for the register to unlock. The store should check the cash drawer limits as this could be a root cause. If the store claims that the drop was processed, then determine who their Procedural/Accounting contact is by following documents VeriBalance Procedural and Configuration Contact Information and VBInsight (Blind Accounting): Call Escalating Procedures and refer or escalate to the appropriate team. If performed correctly, the register alert should clear almost instantly.

6. Arrow over to Options, down to Security <enter>, page down to Cash Drawer



 

7. Ask if the store has a smart safe.

For Customer Service registers with Smart Safe:

Pickup Needed Soon Limit. 5000.00

Pickup Needed Now Limit. 8000.00

 

For Base Options, and Customer Service registers without Smart Safe:

8. If the limits are correct, then the store needs to follow store procedures to do a pickup/drop cash. They can reach out to their division coordinator with questions.

9. If the limits are not correct, please have the store contact their Division to correct as this is procedural.  If the limits do not match on one lane in a range, then options should be copied from a working lane.  Please consult and have Frontend Tier 2 copy options if this is the case.
