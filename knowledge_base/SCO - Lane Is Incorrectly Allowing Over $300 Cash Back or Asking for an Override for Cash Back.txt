Description
SCO Lanes are allowing over $300 cash back on debit and EBT transactions and should be limited to $300 per order.

The lane dispenses this amount and/or prompts to collect it at the pay station via printing a cash voucher.

Note: Previous cash back limits were $100. There was a change approved for the enterprise to change limits to $300 at all stores.

 

Cause
AT/DA/HO/Select NA Stores
Cash back on debit cards is flagged to ask for a Manager's Override for cash back transactions between $100.01 and $299.99.

This flag is enabled only on SCO lanes. Stores will not be able to override over $299.99.

NA506, NA525, NA530, NA558, NA698, NA848

 

Note: Typically what can happen is that the lane will have $300 cash back, and the store will transfer the transaction to the paystation without performing an override causing the problem described in Toshiba SCO - Lane Unexpectedly Adding to Total Due on Cash Transactions

 

Resolution
1. Customer completed an order and asked for over $300 cash back.

2. The lane processed the order and dispensed the amount or printed a cash voucher for pick up.

3. Document the transaction information and the card type (Visa, MasterCard, AmEx, Discover, Etc...)

4. How did the customer enter card? (MSR or Chip)

5. An extract is needed immediately following the transaction.

6. Verify personalization setup for lane:

  - Login to acting master.

    Navigate to Personalization

  - ACE MAIN MENU

  - Personalization

  - Arrow to "File" and "Open Terminal/group"

  - Type in Register number, press Enter

  - Arrow over to "Options"

  - Arrow down to "Tender"

  - Page down to "Tenders"

  - Change ID field to 54 - Debit

  - Page Down to "Tdr Limits"

7. Document in ticket what the value for "Change Limit" is under the "Override Not Allowed" Column.

8. Incorrect Entry is: "+++"; Correct Entry is: "300.00"

9. Do not modify entry.

10. Press 'Esc' or 'F3' all the way back to main menu, do not save any changes.

  - Escalate to APP-Instore Payments, P3 with extract if the entry is "+++" ; otherwise close.

  - If store wishes to have cash back limits changed, they must put the request on the Bi-Way or contact their POS Division coordinator
