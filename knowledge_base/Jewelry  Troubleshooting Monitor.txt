Jewelry: Troubleshooting Monitor
KB0011584
===============================================================================

Description
-----------
Basic troubleshooting steps for Jewelry store monitors.

Cause
-----
Note: A known issue is developing with M93p registers flickering with multiple colors. 
This is a problem with the register, not the monitor. 
Rebooting the register typically stops the flickering. 
If it happens frequently, the register needs to be replaced.

Resolution
----------

SLEEP MODE / POWER SAVE MODE
----------------------------
1. Move the mouse or press any key on the keyboard.
2. If this does not work, press the power button to wake the computer.

Note: Monitors will wake from sleep as soon as they detect a video signal from the register.

MONITOR HAS A SOLID GREEN LIGHT BUT BLACK SCREEN
-------------------------------------------------
1. Press the Adjustment Control button repeatedly.
2. Unplug the power adapter from the back of the monitor 
   (right-hand side when facing screen).
3. Press and hold the monitor’s power button for 30 seconds.
4. Plug the power adapter back in and turn the monitor on.

- If this does not resolve the issue, document:
  * Brand
  * Model number
  * Serial number  
  * Proceed to dispatch. (See Dispatching section)

DIM SCREEN OR COMPLETELY BLACK
------------------------------
1. Verify brightness/contrast settings haven’t been adjusted too dark.
   - Likely will require monitor replacement. See Dispatching section.

2. Power down and reseat the cable connections:
   - 3 cables: 
     * 1 Power 
     * 1 VGA (video) 
     * 1 Audio (optional)

3. If all cables are secure, monitor receives power, but image is not improved, proceed to dispatch.

   - Document all troubleshooting steps taken and visible issues (e.g., dim display, frayed cable, damaged power adapter).

CHECK VGA ADAPTER
-----------------
- Ensure the VGA adapter is securely plugged into the port.

SCREEN RESOLUTION
-----------------
1. Use the GSI (Gemstore Support Interface) tool to auto-adjust screen resolution.
   - See: Jewelry: Gemstore Support Tool (GSI)

2. “Set Screen Resolution” sets resolution to 1028x764 for Gemstore to display correctly.
   - Especially useful after receiving a new monitor or register.

Dell 7050 NOTE:
- Comes with a VGA adapter cable.
  * Ensure adapter is securely connected.
  * Press release button (arrowed) when disconnecting.

BROKEN MONITOR STAND
--------------------
- If the monitor stand is broken, dispatch for replacement.
  * Include store number, ticket number, and description.

ATTACHING MONITOR TO ARM INSTEAD OF STAND
-----------------------------------------
1. Detach monitor base (remove screws securing the stand).
2. Use same screws to attach the monitor to the arm using the mounting holes on the back.
