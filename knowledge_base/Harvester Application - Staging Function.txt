Harvester Application - Staging Function
KB0012660


Description

Staging is the current solution (Modernized Fulfillment Suite or MODFS) for Pickup. Currently Staging is an option inside of the Harvester App. As Staging is part of Harvester it is used by Kroger Associates who use TC52 Zebra Devices. Assume all issues with Harvester staging function at MODFS locations are application issues, and continue with this doc.

 

It is important to note that the Fulfillment Centers supply some Pickup stores with items for orders. The items are picked at the Fulfillment center, and delivered by temperature controlled van to the Pickup store - for the associates there to de-stage from the van - and then stage inside of the store. The Front End Team supports this feature.

 
Resolution
 

Note:  If a store is calling because they cannot stage "hot items", they may not have "Hot Staging Zone" enabled for the store.  Have the store work with their eComm manager.  See:  Division Contacts List / Miscellaneous Contacts

Support for Staging is currently passthrough; each call requires its own ticket; and a template must be filled out before escalation. 

 

**Please review the order in CUE prior to escalation to ensure all items have been properly picked, otherwise the order will not be able to be stages. Ex. "Item Not Ready" will prevent staging.

 

CUE order already picked up but shows staging on the system - fst-harvester - cannot stage a trolley
