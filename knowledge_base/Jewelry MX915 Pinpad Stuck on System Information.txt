IDENTIFYING ISSUE
-----------------
- Check CommType on System Information screen:
  * Correct: RS232
  * Incorrect: ECR

TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS
---------------------
1. Restart Gemstore, have associate sign in.
2. Reseat the patch cable on the back of the register.
   - See: Jewelry: Lenovo Register Patch Cable.
3. Locate the dongle and unplug the Ethernet cable.
4. On the PINPad, hold keys 1, 5, and 9 for 2 seconds.
5. When prompted, enter password:
   - Try 166832
   - If rejected, try 72963687
   - May ask for both Old and New passwords — use both values.

6. Navigate to:
   - Transfer tab → Serial/USB
   - Set Com 2, Baud 115200, click “Go”.

7. Open GSI tool using your PPM credentials.

PRIVILEGED PASSWORD CHECKOUT
----------------------------
8. Close Gemstore.
9. Open MXDownloader.exe at:
   C:\Program Files (x86)\Verifone\MxDownloader

10. Go to Serial tab and set the following:
    - Browse to: C:\Users\Public\Data\Verifone\Release.1.32.0.4870
    - Select: dl-FMJ-FA445-XPI5200p11-PWIC-20180816-25623.tgz
    - Click “Send”

11. Once complete and PINPad reboots, restart Gemstore via Menu Launcher.
12. In GSI, press "Initialize PINPad". This restarts Gemstore.

INITIALIZE PINPAD IN GEMSTORE
-----------------------------
13. Sign into Gemstore → Cancel on customer search
14. Go to Admin tab → Shutdown/Init Pin Pad → Init Pinpad → “Please Wait” appears
15. Sign out, then sign back in

Note: This does NOT work in Windows 11. Use "Reinitialize" from "Extra" button on toolbar instead.

VERIFY TUNA CONFIGURATION
-------------------------
- Check TUNA to confirm PINPad is listed under: FMJ Verifone PINPad on Jewelry Segment.
- If listed under POS/Fuel, move it to Jewelry segment.

DEVICE MANAGER & DRIVER CHECKS
------------------------------
1. Launch GSI from Launcher Menu (PPM credentials).
2. Open Device Manager → Ports (COM & LPT).
3. Confirm PINPad shows as: Prolific USB-to-Serial COMM Port (COM2)
   - If showing as COM1, cable is in wrong dongle port — store must move it to COM2.
   - If not listed, reseat USB patch cable on register.

4. Once listed as COM2, restart Gemstore from Menu Launcher.

VERIFY VerifoneXPI CONFIGURATION
--------------------------------
If problem persists, VerifoneXPI file may have incorrect settings.

1. Open Jewelry Functions:
   - Tools → Jewelry Functions (requires TPAM/privileged password)

2. Select register number in "Select Register" dropdown (bottom-left).
3. In "Select Function" area:
   - Function: File Explorer
   - Click “Run”

4. In opened File Explorer:
   - Navigate to: C:\Beanstore\1_36_0_555\Beanstore\pos
   - Open correct banner folder (e.g., "config" for Fred Meyer Jewelers)
   - Delete file: VerifoneXPI.xml.error (if exists)

5. Open VerifoneXPI.xml in Notepad:
   - If incorrect settings (e.g., baud rate = 9600), rename to: VerifoneXPI.xml.old

6. From a working register, copy the correct VerifoneXPI.xml file to this folder.
7. Restart Gemstore.
8. Confirm Welcome Screen is visible on PINPad.
9. Sign in and initialize the PINPad again.
