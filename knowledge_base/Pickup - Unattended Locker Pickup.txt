**Synopsis:**  
Locker Pickup is an online grocery ordering service offered at select locations. Customers shop online or via the mobile app and retrieve their order from a temperature-controlled locker.

**How It Works**

**Customer / Shopper:**
1. Customer accesses the banner site or mobile app.
2. Chooses a fulfillment method: Pickup, Delivery, or In-Store.
3. Enters zip code and selects a Locker Pickup location.
4. Selects pickup date/time and pays online with a credit/debit card.
5. After fulfillment, receives a **6-digit PIN** via email to retrieve the order.
   - PIN is the last 6 digits of the order number.
   - *Do NOT inform the customer that it is the last 6 digits.*

**Store / Pickup Associate Process:**
1. Monitors locker orders using the **Cue order dashboard** on the Thin Client.
2. Picks order via **Harvester**.
