Jewelry: GemStore Application is not Running
KB0011732



Description

GemStore Application is not Running

 

Cause
Store calls to say that GemStore is not displayed/launched on register. It may have been closed inadvertently by another associate or an error.

 

Resolution
 

Gemstore Stays Minimized or Will Not Load

1.  Ask the store what is on the screen when they say it won't load.  Document in your
     ticket what is on the screen or error.

2.  Have the store check whether the light on the receipt printer is solid or flashing.  If it's flashing, they will need to troubleshoot the receipt printer.  See:  Jewelry: Thermal Printer Troubleshooting 

3.  If the receipt printer is not the issue, try a restart from the Window's start menu (ctrl + alt + del, then restart).

Note:  Sometimes Windows Updates can cause the psexec command that launches GemStore to not work if they are awaiting a reboot to finish installing.  If they cannot restart from the menu, you can have the store do a full power off and back on.

Important:  The store needs to wait at least 20-30 seconds after clicking "Restart GemStore" before clicking on it again.
