POS Touchscreen Missing Buttons

------------------------------------------------------------
Description:
‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: This document is *NOT* to be used for **SCO Lanes**.  
It applies only to **POS terminals** where touchscreen buttons are missing and there is no specific KB article for the missing button(s).

------------------------------------------------------------
Cause:
In some cases, buttons were removed intentionally during a touchscreen layout update.  
For example, CI had Quick Look tabs (soda, salad bar, bakery) removed to:
- Align with Enterprise Layout standards
- Encourage scanning items to reduce shrink

These changes are part of the new **Enterprise Standard**, and quick lookup screens will be updated to match SCO. Bakery PLUs will return in the updated lookup layout.

------------------------------------------------------------
Resolution:

üõ† If a button is:
- **Not functioning**
- **Grayed out**
- **Label is off-center**

‚û°Ô∏è Run the **Terminal Installer** (Refer to: *POS/Fuel/SCO/Pickup/EPRN: POS Terminal Installer For Registers*)

---

### Step-by-Step Troubleshooting:

1. **Identify the issue**:
   - Which button(s) are missing?
   - Was the button ever there or is it newly missing?

2. **Scope**:
   - Is the issue on **one**, **some**, or **all** registers?

3. **Single/Few Registers**:
   - Send a **9-load** to affected registers.
   - If issue persists, continue below.

4. **Multiple/All Registers** or issue persists:
   - Run **Loadshrink** and **Terminal Config**:

#### üîß How to Run Loadshrink:

   1. From Main Menu ‚Üí Select **7. Command Mode**
   2. At the command line, type:
      ```
      adxpldrb -force -loadshrink
      ```
      (This may take time to run.)
   3. When complete, type:
      ```
      adxrtccl
      ```
      (This applies terminal config.)
   4. After script completes, send a **9-load** to affected register(s).
      - Do **NOT** 7-load.
      - 9-load only **two registers at a time**.

üìù **Important**:  
If store uses **IP with offsite fuel center**, check with **Frontend Tier 2** first.

5. **If Loadshrink fails or does not complete**:
   - Transfer the call to **Frontend Tier 2**.

6. If issue still exists after 9-load + successful Loadshrink:
   - Escalate to **Frontend Tier 2** for escalation to **APP-POS**.

------------------------------------------------------------
Summary of Escalation Path:
- If buttons remain missing after:
  - Terminal Installer
  - 9-load
  - Loadshrink + Config
- Then escalate to:
  - **Frontend Tier 2** ‚Üí **APP-POS**
