Resolution

The Mouse and Keyboard are connected via USB ports on the back of the PC.

 
1. Reseat the USB connections located on the back of the PC.

   - The cable connects in a specific way. i.e. symbol on the connector represents the top of plug.

  - The mouse cursor should disappear when you disconnect the mouse USB plug and reappear when reconnected.

  - The lights on the keyboard will go out when disconnected, and turn on when reconnected.

2. Make sure there are no jammed keys on the keyboard.

  - Verify the Num Lock key is on and/or the Caps Lock key is off

  - Turn the keyboard over and tap it lightly on the counter to dislodge debris and stuck keys.

3. If there are still issues with the mouse or keyboard; perform a "Shutdown/Restart" on PC /Register.

4. If there are still issues with the mouse or keyboard; connect to a USB port on front of PC / register. Also try testing the mouse on the other register.

5. If this still does not resolve, for the mouse or keyboard, Dispatch.
