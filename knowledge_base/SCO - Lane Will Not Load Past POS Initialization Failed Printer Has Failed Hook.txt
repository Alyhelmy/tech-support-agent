--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description:
This document outlines the steps to follow when an SCO lane will not load past the error message:
"POS Initialization Failed: Printer Has Failed Hook".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cause:
Printer hardware problems.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Resolution:

1. Troubleshoot Receipt Printer:
   - Verify that paper is loaded correctly and there is no empty roll underneath the current one.
   - Check for any blinking lights on the printer.

2. Power Cycle the Lane:
   - Power off the lane for at least 2 minutes, then power it back on.
   - If the system is System 6 or 7, you do not need to power off the UPS.
   - For Toshiba System 7, use the green button to power cycle; note that some stores may not have access to a UPS.

3. Test the Lane:
   - If the issue is not resolved, send an "8 load" to the lane.

4. Dispatch:
   - If the problem persists, dispatch a technician for the thermal printer as per KSC Hardware Dispatching For All Pillars.
