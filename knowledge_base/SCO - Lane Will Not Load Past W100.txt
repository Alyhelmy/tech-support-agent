Description
-----------
Lane is stuck at or does not load past the W100 error screen:

**W100: PROGRAM CANNOT BE LOADED**

IMPORTANT:  
If **all registers** are showing this and not functioning, this is a **store down**. Escalate immediately to **Frontend Tier 2**.

Cause
-----
- Hard drives were **not properly formatted** when entering the lane number.
- If "W065 Preload Failure" appears in system messages on the controller, refer to the documentation for **W065**.

Resolution
----------
This typically happens **after a tech reformats** the lane.

1. **Send a 9-load** to the terminal.
   - If this resolves it, no further steps are needed.
   - If not, continue to Step 2.

2. **Run CHECUSER**.
   - Refer to documentation: *CHECUSER 2.0*

3. **Likely cause**: Tech pressed S2 twice at the Z001 screen during install, skipping the format step.

4. **Proper STC Reformat Procedure**:
   - Re-STC the lane.
   - At **Z001** screen: Enter terminal ID (1xxx, where xxx = terminal #).
   - Press **S2** ONCE, then wait.
   - When prompted, press **S1**, then press **S2** again at the Z044 screen.
   - ⚠️ Do **not** double tap S1 — this skips formatting and installation must be restarted.

5. **Verify system log** shows "Preload Successful".

6. If **W065 PRELOAD FAILURE - E015** appears:
   - Run **CHECUSER Option 1** to address this.

7. If the tech does **not get option to reformat** at Z001:
   - Have the tech **reseat the hard drive** in the TCU (Terminal Control Unit).

8. If the issue **still persists**:
   - The hard drive is likely **faulty**.
   - Tech should **replace the hard drive**.
