Please verify if all lanes, or single lanes are having this issue and follow the

All Terminals Stuck On W064 Contacting Controller
-------------------------------------------------
1. Call Frontend Tier 2 to IPL all the other controllers.

2. The terminals should reconnect. If not, send a 9-load to reboot the terminals.

One or Two Terminals Stuck on W064 Contacting Controller
--------------------------------------------------------
*Do not run the above script since it is for ALL lanes being affected.*

1. For 1 or 2 registers affected, advise user to hard load those registers.
   See: How To Reboot a Register or Load Terminal Configuration (9-Load).

2. While lane is rebooting, verify the lane switch is pinging:
   Go to PSY > Lookup > Switches.

   Note: W064 is a network issue. Check the switch before running Terminal Installer
   or rebooting controllers.

3. If switch is not pinging, have attendant reboot it. If switch is pinging, continue.

4. Run Terminal Installer.
   See: POS/Fuel/SCO/Pickup/EPRN: POS Terminal Installer For Registers.

   *Do not run Terminal Installer on any SCO Lanes.*

5. If this does not resolve the issue, escalate to Tier 2 if you can display terminal
   status. Dispatch if you cannot display terminal status and have checked network.
