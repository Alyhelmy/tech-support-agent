Description:  
Register or SCO lane freezes at the end of a transaction where a gift card was purchased and is being activated by the system.  
The transaction does not complete because the register is stuck trying to activate the gift card.  
Typically, the transaction will have completed in the Payments System/ACE and does not need to be re-rung.  

Resolution:  
Note: In some cases, when this occurs it can result in SCO lanes with cash stuck in escrow.

1. Confirm that the customer purchased a gift card and the register is currently frozen.  
   - If the register is no longer frozen and the issue is being reported after the fact, link to this document and close the ticket.  

2. Check the Electronic Payments site to verify if the customer’s card has been charged and if the gift card has been activated.  
   - See: POS: How to Research Credit/Debit Transactions in Payment Systems (EPS)  

   Search for **Blackhawk GCM** to check for gift card activation. It will look like the following:

3. Based on findings from EPS:  
   - If the customer has **not** been charged, they can re-ring the transaction on another register.  
   - If the customer **has been charged but gift cards not activated**, follow store procedures for customer care — typically a refund.  
   - If the customer **was charged and gift cards were activated**, a receipt can be printed from ACE.  
     **Do not re-ring the transaction** to avoid a double charge.  

4. Take a terminal dump or perform a push button (green or black power button) extract if this is a SCO lane.  

5. Process and save the dump or note the time/lane # if it's an extract.  

6. Escalate to **APP-Instore-Payments**.  
   - If a dump or extract was not taken, **do not escalate** — close the ticket instead.  
   - Only escalate if data (dump or extract) was collected.
