SCO - Self Checkout Application is Initializing, Waiting for Applications to Load
KB0011228 
=====================================================

DESCRIPTION:
------------
Lane is stuck on:
**"Self Checkout Application is Initializing, Waiting for Applications to Load"**

Alternate screen messages:
- “POS Application is Initializing”
- “POS Initializing”
- May display in white or red text.

-----------------------------------------------------
CAUSE:
------
- Peripheral device not communicating
- Corrupted database
- DB2 in a bad state
- HWSEL file corruption  
  → See: *SCO - Software - How To Delete and/or Copy HWSEL Files*

Improper shutdown is the most common root cause (99%).

-----------------------------------------------------
RESOLUTION:
-----------

🔹 Step 1 – Gather Context:
Ask the store:
- Why was the lane rebooted or powered off?
- Was it having issues with:
  - Accepting/dispensing cash?
  - Printing receipts?
  - Weighing items?

→ Record answers in incident.

🔹 Step 2 – Previous Troubleshooting:
Ask:
- What has the store tried to fix it?
- Were there any similar incidents in the past 2 weeks?

→ Check prior incidents and document findings.

🔹 Step 3 – Educate on Shutdown Procedure:
Improper shutdown (holding the power button) can:
- Corrupt the database
- Damage the hard drive
- Require hard drive replacement or STC

⚠️ NEVER press and hold the black power button unless absolutely necessary.

✅ Correct Shutdown Process:
1. Press the **TCU Black Power Button Once**
2. On-screen menu: Select **Shutdown** or **Restart System**
3. Wait for the lane to fully power off or restart
4. Turn off the UPS **only if the lane is fully powered off**
   - For System 6 or 7: **UPS does not need to be power cycled**

⚠️ Nightly Maintenance Alert:
- **eBOSS Maintenance Window:** 12:05 AM – 5:10 AM EST
- STC actions will not work during this time.
- Wait until after this window to continue replication/STC.
