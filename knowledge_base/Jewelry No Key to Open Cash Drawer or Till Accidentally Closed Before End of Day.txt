Jewelry: No Key to Open Cash Drawer or Till Accidentally Closed Before End of Day
KB0011816 - Latest Version
===============================================================================

Description
-----------
The store is no longer able to run transactions on one or both tills—receiving a "closed" message when logging in. The store accidentally closed the drawer before removing the money and does not have a key.

If they see "Store Closed" in the middle of the screen and cannot perform any functions,
see: Jewelry: Register Shows STORE CLOSED Message When EOD Has Not Been Completed

Cause
-----
Note: This is NOT to be used to correct accounting mistakes or drawer totals.

- Associate tries to log out of Gemstore or open the drawer by pressing “no sale” but hits “close till” instead.
- Associate working at a different store accidentally closes the home store’s till.
- Drawer closed before removing money and store doesn’t have the cash drawer key.

Resolution
----------
If the store closes the drawer before removing money, they should have a cash drawer key to open it manually.

If the key is lost or not working, proceed to the **Starting a New Session** section.

IMPORTANT: A session can be reopened **only** for business needs—not to fix mistakes or variances.

Examples of appropriate reasons to open a new session:
- A till was closed in the morning, leaving only one till available all day.
- Both tills are closed in the middle of the day.
- A till was accidentally closed during a Diamond Show or busy holiday period.
- The store requests a session to be reopened for ongoing business operations.

**Do NOT reopen sessions** to:
- Correct accounting errors
- Fix till variances
- Perform end-of-day corrections

Steps:
------
1. Store must reconcile the closed session now or at end of day, including entering float.
2. In Vision Store Management (VSM):
   Navigate to: CASH FUNCTIONS -> TILLS -> RECONCILE SESSION

Starting a New Session
----------------------
- Must be done using a **KSC Agent ID**—store associate IDs will not have access.
- Ensure the store is in your VSM profile. If not, see: Jewelry: How to Add/Delete/Change Home Store in VSM

Steps:
1. From VSM, go to: CASH FUNCTIONS -> TILLS -> OPEN SESSION
   (Only closed tills will appear here)

2. Select the desired session by checking the dot next to NEW SESSION

3. Enter float details:
   - Enter opening denominations/amount and float amount
   - If float is $0, enter zero

4. When prompted, confirm the session is opened
   - The store can now log into Gemstore again

Cash Drawer Key Replacement
