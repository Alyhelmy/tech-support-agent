Resolution  

If called in by store  
1. If multiple lanes are affected, it may be due to improper shutdown or a controller issue.  
   - Attempt to activate terminal configurations.  
   - Reboot and check if resolved.  
   - If unresolved, escalate to Frontend Tier 2.  
   - Reference How to Activate Terminal, Controller, and System Configurations  

2. Frontend Tier 2  
   - Check for terminal loading issues.  
   - Activate controller configs.  
   - Cold boot the controller assigned to the SCO lanes.  
   - Reference Toshiba SCO - Terminal Transfer How to Verify ControllerLane Setup  

3. If it’s a single lane issue, continue to the next steps.

4. Troubleshoot ScaleScanner or Handscanner (on Sushi Lanes).  
   - These are required devices. Missing communication may prevent the lane from opening.  
   - Reference appropriate scannerscale documentation.

5. If unresolved, dispatch for scannerscale or handscanner hardware.

If called in by technician  
Important Note eBOSS maintenance runs from 1205AM to 510AM EST. STC replication will not complete during this time.

1. If tech is calling post-troubleshooting, STC the lane. The database on the drive may be corrupted.

2. If the lane has already been STC’d  
   - Tech should further troubleshoot scannerscale.  
   - If unresolved, contact NTSTop Gun first.  
   - Then escalate to KSC for escalation to APP-POS.
