POS - Basic Magellan Scale/Scanner Troubleshooting  
KB0011109
===============================================================================

Description
-----------
The scale or scanner is not weighing or scanning correctly.

===============================================================================
Causes
-------
- Display shows **dots** → communication issue  
- Register shows **dashes** → weight table issue

===============================================================================
Resolution Steps
----------------

⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES:
- If **flagged by Weights and Measures**, refer to:  
  "POS - Scale/Scanner: Flagged by Weights and Measures"
- DO NOT MOVE or SWAP scale/scanner hardware — only certified field techs may perform this. Violating this can result in fines.

▶ Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

1. **Check internal display of Scale/Scanner for error codes.**  
   - If **“9” error code**, refer to:  
     “Flashing or Solid 9 EAS Error Display Inside Scale/Scanner”

   - If **display has dots**, proceed to Step 2 (Communication Troubleshooting)

2. **Reset the Scale/Scanner**
   - Have cashier sign on to the register
   - For models: **8xxx, 95xx, 9800i**, hold down **VOLUME/TONE button** for **10 seconds**

   - If issue persists or shows **"A" error**, continue to Step 3

3. **Tap Reset Sequence**
   - Press **VOLUME/TONE button** three times quickly
   - If the unit starts beeping repeatedly, press it **one more time**

4. **Power Cycle the Register**
   - Shut down the register  
   - Ensure **Scale/Scanner loses power**  
     → If not, it may be powered independently (via power switch or battery backup) — power it off directly  
   - Leave powered off for **at least 30 seconds**

5. **Clean Under Scale Platter**
   - Ensure no obstructions or debris are present
   - Check that nothing is on or touching the scale

6. **Check Connections**
   - Reseat the USB cable between the Scale/Scanner and register (if possible)

7. **Power On and Test**
   - If issue persists → **Dispatch via KSC Hardware Dispatching for All Pillars**

8. **Check for Sensormatic Devices**
   - Some models (e.g., 9800i) may include external Sensormatic hardware — ensure it is **not too close** to the scanner

Model-Specific Notes
---------------------

▶ Magellan 9800i Indicators:

- **Dashes** = Weigh Table Error  
  → Clean under platter, check for obstructions, zero the scale using top button

- **Dots** = No Communication  
  → Follow Steps 2–4 above, reseat USB, power cycle (minimum 30 seconds)
