Description
Lane was rebooted and is stuck on:
"POS Initialization Failed: Unable to post data due to persistent system busy condition"

Cause
- Software issue
- Hardware issue: If stuck on "POS Initialization Failed: Printer Failed Hook", usually means the printer is out of paper.
  See: SCO - Hardware - Lane will not load past "POS Initialization Failed: Printer Failed Hook" for printer-related resolution.

Resolution

Scenario:
1. SCO lane was shutdown, power cycled, or restarted.
2. Lane boots to the closed screen.
3. "POS Initialization Failed" white window appears on the right half of the screen when attempting to open the lane.

Steps:

1. Note why the lane was restarted (e.g., lane freeze). One ticket covers this.

2. Check exact error message in the POS Initialization Failed window:
   - “Unable to post data due to persistent system busy condition”
   - OR “Unable to access remote session server”

3. If error is “Printer Failed Hook”, follow printer hardware doc for resolution.

4. Send an 8-load to the lane while the error displays.
   - See: SCO - MISC - How To Perform and Prepare Terminal or TCU Dump.
   - Only one dump at a time; avoid multiple dumps to prevent performance issues. Use 9-loads for attempts to resolve afterwards.

5. If still stuck, power off the lane and check for any EAMTS files on all controllers; rename these files.
   - See: POS/SCO: How to Rename EAMTS File For A Register - Frontend Tier 2 ONLY

6. Power lane back on and have the associate try to open the lane.
   - If issue persists, verify the lane is listed in Operator Authorization under ACE Level *9.
   - See: How To Check Operator ID's in ACE and Authorization Levels and SCO Lanes

7. If lane is not listed in Operator Authorization, escalate to APP-POS as:
   - P3 for one lane
   - P2 for multiple lanes

8. Check for any lane devices showing error conditions; troubleshoot and fix those.

9. If issue remains for a single lane, dispatch technician per KSC Hardware Dispatching For All Pillars.

10. For multiple lanes with no hardware issues, escalate to Frontend Tier 2 to escalate to APP-POS (P2) with a terminal dump.
