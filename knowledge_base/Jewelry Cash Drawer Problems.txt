Resolution
----------

**IMPORTANT:** Include the Register Build Number (bottom-right of GemStore screen) in the incident title.

Since the cash drawer is connected to the receipt printer, printer issues can impact drawer functionality.  
**First**, verify the receipt printer’s power light is solid green.  
If not, see: *Jewelry: Thermal Printer Troubleshooting*

---------------------------------
1. Determine if this is a hardware issue:
---------------------------------

**A. Test the Cash Drawer via Admin tab:**
- Go to `Admin > No Sale`, select an option to attempt opening the drawer.

**Do they hear the solenoid *click* when trying to open it?**

→ **Yes, click heard:**
- Cash drawer may be jammed.
- Use the *till key* to manually open and check for obstructions.

→ **No click heard:**
- Continue with cable checks below.

---------------------------------
2. Check cables between cash drawer and receipt printer:
---------------------------------

**A. Cable should be firmly plugged in.**
- One end into the **back of the printer**, one into the **back of the cash drawer**.

**B. Proper cable orientation:**
- Ends are labeled: `EPSON` and `C/D`.
  - `EPSON` goes into the printer.
  - `C/D` goes into the cash drawer.

**C. Accessing cable ports:**
- Tilt the printer onto its front.
- Unlatch the hinged door to access cable connections.

---------------------------------
3. Still not working?
---------------------------------

- Reseat the cable at both ends (printer and drawer).
- Restart the register.

> ⚠️ Always stay on the line with the store while the register reboots.  
> If **both Reg 1 and Reg 2 are down**, this is a **store down** situation.
  - Escalate via **Frontend Tier 2** to **App-Merch-ORE2.0-Jewelry Sev. 2** if unresolved.

---------------------------------
4. Hardware Dispatch
---------------------------------
- If drawer is not repaired and issue persists:
  - Dispatch for part replacement.  
  - See: Dispatch Section.

If store needs new keys, assign ticket to: `DIV-FM-Parts`.
