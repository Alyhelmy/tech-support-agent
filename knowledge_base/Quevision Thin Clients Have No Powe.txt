Description:  
The Quevision thin clients attached to the back of the monitors are not powered on.  

Cause:  
The thin client has lost power due to an electrical or store power issue.  

Resolution:  

A. Verify that the power supplied to the thin client is working:  
1. Have the user check the outlet for power with another device, if possible.  
   - Note: If the power outlet is not accessible for store users, dispatch the appropriate vendor.  

2. If the power source does not have power, the store should contact local facilities for an electrician to investigate the power issue.  

3. If the power source does have power, continue to step B.  

B. Perform a power reset:  
1. Remove the power connector from both the thin client and the wall outlet.  
   - Wait **2 to 5 minutes** before reconnecting. (This wait is critical.)  

2. Reconnect the power and turn on the thin client.  
   - Verify that predictions appear on the screen.  
   - If predictions are still missing, refer to: *QueVision Monitors do not match the Dashboard*.  

3. If the thin client still does not power on, dispatch the appropriate vendor for hardware support.
